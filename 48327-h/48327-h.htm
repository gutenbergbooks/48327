<h3><i>CHAPTER VIII.</i><br />

THE LITHUANIAN AND LIVONIAN ORDERS.</h3>

<p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, three new races
entered Slavonia whose character essentially modified its
subsequent history. From the northwest came the Germans,
from the east the Tartar Mongols, from the west the
Lithuanians. The modern Russian divisions of Livonia
and Esthonia, with the outlying regions, were peopled in
the ninth century with the Tchud or Lett tribes, of the Finnish
race,—the most ancient, it is believed, of living European
peoples. The Russian Finns of the present time number
one and a half million souls; but though they long retained
their distinctive nationality, they have yielded to
the process of “Russification,” and to-day, among the majority
of them, their ancient character is noticeable merely by
certain peculiarities of physiognomy and dialect. They are
short and thick of stature, tough as oak, and of a hickory
hue. The countenance is blurred and unfinished, so to
speak. The face is broad and flat, the cheek bones high,
the nose depressed and bridgeless. Their dialects are
primitive and meager. Their manners and superstitions
are traceable to the earliest of known races; their religious
observances antedate those of any known form of paganism.
They remain, in fact, pagan at heart, loyal to their
ancient gods, though with these they are willing to give
Saint Nicholas some qualified homage. They recognize a
good and an evil principle, both to be equally revered. An
offspring and mingling of the two is Keremet, who, with
his progeny of Keremets, is more mischievous than malevolent,
and to whom, far in the depths of the forests,
offerings and sacrifices are made. The evil principle is
Shaïtan, philologically allied with the Arabic Shatana,
and the still older Hebrew Sâtân. The Finn buys his
bride, by paying to her father a <i>kalm</i> or fee. With his fellows
he practices an agricultural communism. Through
a thousand years he has remained without education, incapable,
apparently, of progress, unchangeable. At present,
however, the Russian Finn, along with the other races
of the country, is being merged into the ubiquitous, self-asserting
Russian.</p>

<p>The Baltic Letts, occupying Esthonia, had been subjugated
by the Dane, Knut the Great, the conqueror of England.
But Livonia had submitted to the arms of Iaroslaf
the Great, who founded there Iurief, later called Dorpat;
and Mstislaf, son of Vladimir Monomakh, had taken one of
the chief cities of the Tchudi. The princes of Polotsk and
the republic of Novgorod claimed the country and virtually
bore rule over it. To Livonia early in the twelfth century
came the German merchant in search of trade, and the
Latin priest, seeking souls for his hire and subjects for his
Pope. The monk Meinhard, commissioned by the Archbishop
of Bremen, compulsorily brought the Livonians
under his sway, and was constituted bishop of their country.
But this invasion of a stranger race bearing the wares
of commerce, and the authority of Rome behind the symbol
of the cross, implied the overthrow of the untutored but
brave descendants of the Tchud hero Kalevy, the extinction
of their liberties and their independence. In 1187
Meinhard completed a church at Uexhüll, and surrounded
it with a fortification. Eleven years later the tribes revolted
against their episcopal master, and killed him in open
warfare. They then plunged into the Dwina to wash off
and send back to Germany their baptism, and restored to
their shrines their ancient gods. Innocent III preached a
crusade against them, and another bishop, commander of a
large fleet, built for his capital the town of Riga (1200). In
the following year was established the Order of the Brothers
of the Army of Christ, or the Sword Bearers, later
known as the Livonian Knights, “men of iron,” who broke
the strength of the tribes, and against whom the Russian
princes, occupied with their own dissensions, made no
united resistance. The knights intrenched themselves
firmly in the regions whither they hewed with the sword a
pathway for the cross, and built fortifications of cemented
stone, that were a wonder and a terror to the simple natives,
who were driven in herds to the waters of baptism, or
massacred if they offered resistance. A song of the Tchudi
of Pskof, entitled “The Days of Slavery,” commemorates
this period of misery: “Destroying fiends were unchained
against us. The priests strangled us with their rosaries, the
greedy knights plundered us, murderers with their weapons
cut us in pieces. The father of the cross stole our wealth; he
stole the treasure from the hiding place. He hewed down
the sacred tree, he polluted the fountain, the waters of
salvation. The axe smote the oak of Tara, the cruel hatchet
the tree of Kero.”</p>

<p>About 1225, a second military order established itself in
Livonia, and built four considerable towns, among them
Thorn and Koenigsberg, in the depopulated country. Their
black cross was borne, along with the red cross of the sword-bearers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and in course of time the two orders became associated,
and together imposed a crushing servitude upon the
remnants of the Tchudi, who were reduced to a form of
serfdom; and though in later times their liberty has been
yielded them again, the German nobility retained their
lands. The aboriginal Livonian remained ever separate
from his conqueror, the Papal German. The Kalevy-Poeg,
the epic of the Tchud Esthonians, recites the career of the
son of Kalev, the personification of the race, the hero of
Titanic force. He swam the Gulf of Finland. His club
was the trunk of an oak; with his horse and his immense
harrow he plowed all Esthonia; he exterminated the beasts
of prey, conquered the magicians of Finland, and the genii
of the caves. He descended into hell and had single combat
with Sarvig, the horned. He sailed to the ends of the earth,
and when the fiery breath of the northern spirits burned his
vessel, he built another of silver. When the heavens were
lurid with the flames of these spirits, he laughed and said
to his pilot: “With their darts of fire they light us on our
way, since the sun has gone to rest, and we are passed beyond
the daylight.” No fury of the elements could destroy
him. He went to the isle of flame, of smoke, and of boiling
water, where the mountains throw forth fire (Iceland).
There he encountered a giant woman, who, plucking grass
for her kine, crushed with it several of his sailors, as if they
had been insects. He fought with men whose bodies were
those of dogs, possibly the Greenland Esquimaux; and
pauses in his onward strides only when told by a magician
that the wall of the world’s end is still far away. When he
is told of the landing of the sword-bearers, the men whose
armor can neither be pierced with the spear nor cleft with
the axe, his unconquerable heart is troubled. He seeks the
tomb of his father for counsel, but the place is silent; the
leaves murmur plaintively, the winds sigh, the dew itself
is moved, the eye of the clouds is wet, all Esthonian nature
shares in the forebodings of the national hero. He gathers
his warriors by the Embach, and raises the battle cry.
Bloody is the field, mournful the victory! All the brave are
slain, the brothers of Kalevy-Poeg among them. His
charger is cut down by the hand of the stranger. He who
had overcome the demon Sarvig, who had laughed at the
spirits of the north, could not subdue the men of iron,
whose strength surpassed that of the gods. Captive to
Mana, god of death, his wrist held fast in a cleft of the rock
hard by the gate of hell, he comes no more to vindicate the
liberties of his sons, his people. Long looked they for his
return; but like his kinsman, perhaps his sire, Kolyvan,
who lies under the rock whereon is built the city of Revel,
he is holden captive of Mana. Thus sorrowfully closes the
career of the Arthur of this primitive people.</p>

<p>The German planted region was destined to be a thorn in
the side of Russia. Protracted wars were maintained between
the foreigners of the west and the Slavs of the realm.
Four hundred years passed ere an appearance of tranquillity
and of union was attained; and even now the governments
of Esthonia and Livonia are not among the more trusted
provinces of the empire. The people of that region, restive
under absolutism, dimly conscious of rights withheld, and of
oppressive restrictions, encourage the spirit of revolution,
and invite to their sea-bordered home many of the malcontents
of the empire.</p>

<p>Up to the opening of the thirteenth century, Russian
civilization had kept a relative pace with that of the east.
Receiving industries, arts and religion from Byzantium,
and civic form from Scandinavia, it had been united under
Iaroslaf the Great, and had maintained with some degree of
order feudal divisions corresponding to those of the other
European nations in the same centuries. This relative development
the empire bade fair to maintain without serious
lapses, when a calamity utterly without precedent, immeasurably
disastrous, suddenly fell upon the realm, and
shattered her incipient civilization beyond the power of repairing.
Nature has been a step-mother to Russia, says one
of her native historians. Fate was a second, a harsher step-mother.</p>

<p>“In those times, (1224) there came upon us, on account of
our sins, unknown nations,” write the chroniclers. No one
could tell their origin, whence they came, what religion
they professed. “God alone knew who they were: God, and
perhaps a few wise men learned in books.” All Europe was
affrighted at the apparition of these Asiatic hordes. The
Pope and the sovereigns prepared to meet them with combined
forces. But upon Russia alone fell the shock, the
subjugation, the humiliating servitude, imposed by these
numberless and mysterious armies, whom it was whispered
among the people were Gog and Magog, prophesied to come
at the end of the world, when all things would be destroyed
by anti-Christ.</p>

<p>The Ta-ta, Das, or Tatars were Mongol, pastoral tribes,
settled at the base of the Altai Mountains. Occupied exclusively
with their flocks, they wandered from pasture to
pasture, from river to river. The Land of Grass is the name
given to-day, by the inhabitants, to modern Tartary. They
built no walls nor towns, knew nothing of writing or of arts
beyond the simplest. Their treaties were made orally.
They were equally destitute of laws and of religion, save
perhaps a vague adoration of the sun. They respected nothing
but strength and bravery: age and weakness they despised,
and like other barbarians, they left the pining, the
feeble and the aged among them to perish. Their food was
milk and the flesh of their herds: their clothing was made
of the skins of their animals. They practiced polygamy,
and had a community of wives; when the father died the
son married his younger wives. Trained to ride from their
infancy, they were taught also to let fly their arrows at birds
and other small creatures, and thus acquired the courage
and skill essential to their predatory existence. They had
no infantry, and laid no sieges. When they would capture
a town, they fell upon the suburban villages. Each leader
seized ten men and compelled them to carry wood, stones,
and whatever material was accessible for the filling up of
fosses. The prisoners were also forced to dig trenches. But
save for purposes of utility, they took no prisoners, choosing
rather the extermination of the entire population.</p>

<p>This barbarous and appalling people, in their earlier advances,
invaded China, whither they passed with incomprehensible
suddenness: nor of the direction of their movements,
nor of their departure could aught be presaged. The
present dynasty of that country is of the Mantchoo Tatars,
who, in respect of political influence, are dominant in the
empire.</p>

<p>As they increased and formed a rude nationality, a mighty
chief arose among them, Temutchin, or Genghis Khan. In
a general congress of their princes, assembled early in the
thirteenth century, he proclaimed himself emperor, averring
that as but one sun shone in the heavens, in like manner
the whole earth should be subject to one sole sovereign.
Placing himself at the head of this nation, composed of half
a million armed cavalry, he initiated a widely devastating
conquest, by destroying the teeming populations of Mantchuria,
Tangut, Northern China, Turkestan, Great Bokhara,
and the remainder of Western Asia to the plains of
the Crimea.</p>

<p>The ruin inflicted by these wild hordes has never been
repaired. During the captainship of Genghis Khan, an approximately
correct estimate shows that eighteen million
five hundred thousand human beings were slaughtered by
his horsemen in China and Tangut alone. Turkestan, once
called the Garden of the East, and Great Bokhara, after the
lapse of six centuries, bear the evidences of the Tatar invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
on their many depopulated wastes. Upon the occupation
of Nessa, a town in Kiva, the people were bound together
in couples, and above seventy thousand were despatched
thus by the Tatar arrows. At Merv, seven hundred
thousand, or, according to another authority, one million
three hundred thousand corpses were left to corrupt the
atmosphere once teeming with life, and rich in its bountiful
fruitfulness. At Nishapoor, in Persia, seven hundred
and forty-seven thousand lives were extinguished. To prevent
the living from hiding under the piles of the dead, the
bodies were decapitated. At Herat, in Afghanistan, one
million six hundred thousand were mowed down by the
Tatar cimetars. After the enemy had vanished, forty persons,
the mournful remnant from the massacre, came together
in the principal mosque of the ruined city. These
regions have never recovered a tithe of their former prosperity.</p>

<h4>PRONOUNCING LIST OF RUSSIAN PROPER NAMES.</h4>

<p><i>Explanation of signs used</i>: [<i>=a</i>], [<i>=e</i>], [<i>=i</i>], [<i>=o</i>], [<i>=u</i>], long, as in <i>fate</i>,
<i>mete</i>, <i>mite</i>, <i>mote</i>, <i>mute</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>)a</i>], [<i>)e</i>], [<i>)i</i>], [<i>)o</i>], short, as in <i>add</i>, <i>met</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>off</i>.</p>

<p><i>ö</i> like the prolonged sound of <i>e</i> in <i>her</i>.</p>

<p><i>ä</i>, the Italian <i>a</i>, as in <i>arm</i>.</p>

<p><i>ï</i>, the Italian <i>i</i>, like [<i>=e</i>].</p>

<p><i>o</i>, in the syllables of most Russian words, has a sound between
[<i>=o</i>] and [<i>)o</i>]. For typographical reasons, however, we
give simply the [<i>=o</i>], advising that the vowel sound be not
made too long.</p>

<p><i>u</i>, in most Russian syllables, has a liquid sound like <i>yu</i>.</p>

<p>Consonants, when succeeding one another, unite their
sounds rapidly. Thus, in <i>Svi-at´o-slaf</i>, the sounds of <i>s</i> and
<i>v</i> follow one another much as <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> unite in the English
word <i>step</i>.</p>

LITERATURE OF SCANDINAVIA.</a></h2>

<h3>V.—THE ROMANCE OF AXEL.</h3>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>Translated by L. A. SHERMAN, <span class="smcap">Ph.D.</span></p>

<p>We promised ourselves at the beginning of these papers a
little entertainment betweenwhiles, and we have had rather
dry reading lately. The political history of Scandinavia is
not very fascinating, except here and there a period or a
reign. Let us then declare a breathing space, and spend
half an hour with Tegnér [Teng-nar´], the most brilliant and
popular poet of the Swedes; besides, it will not be out of order,
for it is of the glorious <i>Carolinska Tid</i>, or age of Charles
XII., that we shall hear. Of Tegnér we shall learn hereafter,
and I hope when we have read his poem we shall want
to know a great deal about him. The story is called “Axel”
[Ahk-sel], from the name of the hero, and explains itself. We
make no pretentions to reproducing the poetry, but only
something of the directness and force, of the original.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ancient days are dear to me,</span></div>
<div class="verse">The days of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden,</div>
<div class="verse">For they were blithe as peace of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">And they were bold as victory.</div>
<div class="verse">Nor yet their after-glow hath faded</div>
<div class="verse">From northern skies which time hath shaded,</div>
<div class="verse">But tall and stalwart forms we view,</div>
<div class="verse">With belts of gold and coats of blue,</div>
<div class="verse">Move up and down when evening blushes.</div>
<div class="verse">With reverence my spirit hushes</div>
<div class="verse">To see you, men of nobler day,</div>
<div class="verse">With jerkins buff and steel array.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I knew in childhood’s days long flown</span></div>
<div class="verse">One whom King Charles had held of worth.</div>
<div class="verse">He still remained upon the earth</div>
<div class="verse">A trophy, ruinous and lone.</div>
<div class="verse">From locks a century old there shone</div>
<div class="verse">The only silver he possessed,</div>
<div class="verse">And scars told on his brow and breast</div>
<div class="verse">What runes tell on a bauta-stone.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Though he was poor, he understood</div>
<div class="verse">Want was no foe, but friend concealed;</div>
<div class="verse">He lived as if still in the field,</div>
<div class="verse">His home a hut within the wood.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet had he treasures twain in hoard,</div>
<div class="verse">And deemed them of all wealth the best,—</div>
<div class="verse">His Bible and his ancient sword,</div>
<div class="verse">Which bore Carl Twelfth’s name deep impressed.</div>
<div class="verse">The mighty king’s illustrious deeds,</div>
<div class="verse">Which now no farthest zone but reads</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>(For wide that eagle flew around),</div>
<div class="verse">All lay within the old man’s mind</div>
<div class="verse">As urns of warriors lie enshrined</div>
<div class="verse">Within the green-clad burial mound.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! when he told of risks gone through</div>
<div class="verse">For Charles, and for his lads in blue,</div>
<div class="verse">How swelled his frame, how proud and high,</div>
<div class="verse">How brightly gleamed his kindled eye!</div>
<div class="verse">And mighty as a sabre stroke</div>
<div class="verse">Rang every word the old man spoke.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus oft till late at night he sat,</div>
<div class="verse">And told again the tales we claimed,</div>
<div class="verse">And every time King Charles was named</div>
<div class="verse">Failed not to lift his tattered hat.</div>
<div class="verse">I stood in wonder at his knee</div>
<div class="verse">(No higher reached my wistful face),</div>
<div class="verse">And pictures of his hero-race</div>
<div class="verse">Hath memory kept till now for me;</div>
<div class="verse">And many a saga then enshrined</div>
<div class="verse">Hath since remained within my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">As iris-germs beneath the snow</div>
<div class="verse">In slumber wait their time to grow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old man sleeps in death forgot:</span></div>
<div class="verse">Peace to his dust! A tale which stirred</div>
<div class="verse">My youth receive. When thou hast heard,</div>
<div class="verse">Weep, North, with me for Axel’s lot.</div>
<div class="verse">Beside the old man’s words sublime</div>
<div class="verse">My song is weak, in humble rhyme.</div>
<div class="center">———</div>
<div class="verse">In Bender Sweden’s sovereign lay.</div>
<div class="verse">His foes had torn his lands away,</div>
<div class="verse">His glory sinking out of sight.</div>
<div class="verse">His people, like a wounded knight,</div>
<div class="verse">Who even feels death’s creeping chill,</div>
<div class="verse">Rose on its knees, resisting still,</div>
<div class="verse">And hope of rescue there was none,</div>
<div class="verse">Except in Charles, the absent one.</div>
<div class="verse">Although the leaves in Fate’s dark book</div>
<div class="verse">Turned in the storm, though nature shook,</div>
<div class="verse">He stood calm like the bomb-proof wall,</div>
<div class="verse">When sacked and burning cities fall,</div>
<div class="verse">Like rocks lashed wildly by the wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Like Resignation on a grave.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The king had called, one afternoon,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Young Axel in, the brave dragoon.</div>
<div class="verse">“Here, take this letter, and—away!</div>
<div class="verse">Ride for your life both night and day,</div>
<div class="verse">And straightway when you reach our land,</div>
<div class="verse">Deliver to the council’s hand.</div>
<div class="verse">Go with God’s help, set forth to-night,</div>
<div class="verse">And greet our hills and northern light!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young Axel dearly loved to ride,</span></div>
<div class="verse">And glad he sewed the letter in</div>
<div class="verse">His hollow belt. At Holofzin</div>
<div class="verse">His father fell the king beside,</div>
<div class="verse">And orphaned thus this son of arms</div>
<div class="verse">Grew up amid the camp’s alarms.</div>
<div class="verse">His frame was strong, such as of old,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose like have not yet vanished all,</div>
<div class="verse">Fresh as a rose, but slight and tall,</div>
<div class="verse">Like pines upon the Swedish mould.</div>
<div class="starbreak">******</div>
<div class="verse">The keen-eyed king had placed him in</div>
<div class="verse">His body-guard, souls near of kin.</div>
<div class="verse">They numbered seven, a slender troop</div>
<div class="verse">As are the stars of Charles’s Wain,</div>
<div class="verse">At most nine, like the muses’ group,</div>
<div class="verse">And hard the honor was to gain.</div>
<div class="verse">By sword and fire their claims were tried,</div>
<div class="verse">They were a Christian viking-stock,</div>
<div class="verse">Not unlike that which once defied</div>
<div class="verse">All dangers of the wave and rock.</div>
<div class="verse">They never slept upon a bed,</div>
<div class="verse">But on their cloaks spread on the ground,</div>
<div class="verse">In storms and northwest snows as sound</div>
<div class="verse">As if on daisied meads instead.</div>
<div class="verse">A horse-shoe they could press together,</div>
<div class="verse">And never in the wildest weather</div>
<div class="verse">Approached the hearthstone’s crackling light,</div>
<div class="verse">But warmed themselves with shot,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> each one,</div>
<div class="verse">As red as when the rayless sun</div>
<div class="verse">Goes down in blood some winter’s night.</div>
<div class="verse">The rule was when in strife exposed</div>
<div class="verse">That one might yield if seven opposed,</div>
<div class="verse">His breast still turned to their attack,</div>
<div class="verse">For none must ever see his back.</div>
<div class="verse">And last there was this law beside,</div>
<div class="verse">The most austere, perhaps, of all,</div>
<div class="verse">To let no maid bring them in thrall,</div>
<div class="verse">Till Charles himself should take a bride.</div>
<div class="verse">However blue two eyes might smile,</div>
<div class="verse">However red two lips beguile,—</div>
<div class="verse">They all must shut their eyes—or flee:</div>
<div class="verse">Their swords were pledged, they must be free.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young Axel saddled glad his steed,</span></div>
<div class="verse">And rode both night and day with speed.</div>
<div class="verse">When Ukrane’s boundaries drew near</div>
<div class="verse">The sudden gleam of lance and spear</div>
<div class="verse">Flashed round him, spurring through a wood.</div>
<div class="verse">At once the ambush rose and stood:</div>
<div class="verse">“Thou art the bearer of commands;</div>
<div class="verse">Give up the letter to our hands,</div>
<div class="verse">Dismount and give it up, or die.”</div>
<div class="verse">Then rang his sword its swift reply,</div>
<div class="verse">And he who spoke, grown wondrous meek,</div>
<div class="verse">Bowed to the earth with piercing shriek.</div>
<div class="verse">His back now screened against an oak</div>
<div class="verse">Now Axel meets each stroke with stroke.</div>
<div class="verse">Wherever fell that ponderous sword,</div>
<div class="verse">There knees were bent and blood was poured;</div>
<div class="verse">And thus he gave his oath support.</div>
<div class="verse">Not one to seven, that were but sport,</div>
<div class="verse">But one to twenty rang his blade:</div>
<div class="verse">Resistance such as Krakë made.</div>
<div class="verse">To life by hope no longer bound,</div>
<div class="verse">He sought but fellowship in death.</div>
<div class="verse">The purple mouth of many a wound,</div>
<div class="verse">Now whispers with enfeebled breath</div>
<div class="verse">That strength and life are taking flight.</div>
<div class="verse">His hand no longer knows the steel,</div>
<div class="verse">And swooning darkness sets its seal</div>
<div class="verse">Upon his eyes, he sinks in night.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Halloo!” With shouts the wood resounds,</span></div>
<div class="verse">And falcons bold and faithful hounds</div>
<div class="verse">Press hard upon their frightened prey,</div>
<div class="verse">And now the hunters dash this way.</div>
<div class="verse">And first upon a roan-flecked steed,</div>
<div class="verse">And vying with the wind for speed,</div>
<div class="verse">An Amazon rides like a queen,</div>
<div class="verse">With cheek of rose and robe of green.</div>
<div class="verse">The robber gang affrighted fled,</div>
<div class="verse">But she whose steed chafed at the dead</div>
<div class="verse">Dismounted with a single bound</div>
<div class="verse">Where lay he, as within some dale</div>
<div class="verse">An oak thrown prostrate by the gale</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>Lies on the copse which clothes the ground.</div>
<div class="verse">How fair he lay, though bathed in gore!</div>
<div class="verse">And over him Maria<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> bent,</div>
<div class="verse">As fair Diana long before</div>
<div class="verse">On Latmos, also well content</div>
<div class="verse">That dogs and din of chase were gone,</div>
<div class="verse">Bent over her Endymion.</div>
<div class="verse">The slumberer who caused her bliss</div>
<div class="verse">Was surely not more fair than this.</div>
<div class="verse">A spark of life had still endured</div>
<div class="verse">Within his breast, and, soon procured,</div>
<div class="verse">They raise the fallen to a bier</div>
<div class="verse">Of interwoven twigs, and bear</div>
<div class="verse">It slowly forth with reverent care,</div>
<div class="verse">And seek her dwelling, which was near.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">She sat beside his couch, oppressed</span></div>
<div class="verse">With anxious cares that leave their trace,</div>
<div class="verse">And fastened on his pallid face</div>
<div class="verse">A look well worth a realm’s acquest.</div>
<div class="verse">She sat as in the groves of Greece</div>
<div class="verse">(That land of beauty overthrown),</div>
<div class="verse">The wild rose blooms in noiseless peace</div>
<div class="verse">By prostrate Hercules in stone.</div>
<div class="verse">At last he wakes to consciousness,</div>
<div class="verse">And looks around him in distress.</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! his eye before so mild</div>
<div class="verse">Now glares deliriously wild.</div>
<div class="verse">“Where am I? Girl, why art thou here?</div>
<div class="verse">To King Carl’s service I am bound,</div>
<div class="verse">And must not look on thee; thy tear</div>
<div class="verse">I will not have within my wound.—</div>
<div class="verse">My sire beyond the milky way</div>
<div class="verse">Is wroth: he heard the oath I took.</div>
<div class="verse">How fair, though, is the tempter’s look!</div>
<div class="verse">How winning! Satan, hence, away!—</div>
<div class="verse">Where is my belt and my commands?</div>
<div class="verse">I took them from my king’s own hands.</div>
<div class="verse">My father’s sword is good, it smites</div>
<div class="verse">With special hate on Muscovites.—</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! what delight it was to slay!</div>
<div class="verse">I would the king had seen the fray:</div>
<div class="verse">Like prostrate harvests lay the dead.</div>
<div class="verse">It almost seemed I also bled.—</div>
<div class="verse">I bore dispatches from the war,</div>
<div class="verse">My honor stands in pledge therefor.</div>
<div class="verse">Waste not a moment more,—away!”</div>
<div class="verse">She heard his ravings with dismay,</div>
<div class="verse">While swooning sank her hero then</div>
<div class="verse">Exhausted on his couch again.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus grappled life with death anew</span></div>
<div class="verse">Till life had won the youth at last,</div>
<div class="verse">And slowly was the danger passed,</div>
<div class="verse">When Axel now could calmly view</div>
<div class="verse">With glance restored, though weak and dim,</div>
<div class="verse">The angel bending over him.</div>
<div class="verse">She was not like the idyl’s queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Who roves and sighs in groves of green,</div>
<div class="verse">The counterfeit of languishing,</div>
<div class="verse">With locks bright gold like suns of spring,</div>
<div class="verse">And cheeks deep-dyed as Julian flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">And eyes like blue-bells after showers.</div>
<div class="verse">She was an Oriental maid.</div>
<div class="verse">Her dark, rich locks which fell unstayed,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed midnight round a bed of roses;</div>
<div class="verse">And on her brow was throned the grace</div>
<div class="verse">Of cheerfulness, as in the face</div>
<div class="verse">An Amazonian shield exposes,—</div>
<div class="verse">The face and mien of victory.</div>
<div class="verse">Its hue was like Aurora’s haze,</div>
<div class="verse">Which artists paint with clouds of rays.</div>
<div class="verse">Of form so shapely, gait so free,</div>
<div class="verse">She seemed a Dryad from the grove;</div>
<div class="verse">And high and deep her bosom’s sea</div>
<div class="verse">Of youth and health swelled ceaselessly.</div>
<div class="verse">A body all divinely wove</div>
<div class="verse">Of roses red and lilies white,</div>
<div class="verse">A soul of only fire and light,—</div>
<div class="verse">A summer and a southern sky</div>
<div class="verse">With fragrance filled and golden beams.</div>
<div class="verse">She cast on all a glance as proud</div>
<div class="verse">As looks Jove’s eagle from the cloud,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet mild as are the doves that bear</div>
<div class="verse">The car of Venus through the air.</div>

<div class="verse">Together rove the hours away.</div>
<div class="verse">As groom and bride change rings, so they</div>
<div class="verse">Exchanged their childhood’s memories.</div>

<div class="verse">Their throng, and myriad-answering neigh.</div>

<div class="verse">A life before of little worth.</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! although we strive from birth,</div>

<div class="verse">A withering vine if not upheld,</div>
<div class="verse">A being with its half withheld:</div>
<div class="verse">No unshared joy can she possess,</div>

<div class="verse">They kissed as kiss in sacrifice</div>
<div class="verse">Two altar-flames, which thus unite,</div>

<p>“There is in human nature a general inclination to make
people stare; and every wise man has himself to cure of it,
and does cure himself. If you wish to make people stare
by doing better than others, why make them stare till they
stare their eyes out! But consider how easy it is to make
people stare by being absurd. I may do it by going into a
drawing-room without my shoes. You remember the gentleman
in ‘The Spectator,’ who had a commission of lunacy
taken out against him for his extreme singularity, such as
never wearing a wig, but a night-cap. Now, sir, abstractedly,
the night-cap was best: but, relatively, the advantage
was overbalanced by his making the boys run after him.”—<i>Boswell,

<h3>VI.—A PICTURESQUE HALF-CENTURY.</h3>

<p>A picture of the times of Edward III should be one of
strong lights and shades. His fifty years were crowded
with events remarkable in their nature and of powerful influence
on England, then and thereafter. His wars by land
and sea revolutionized the military ideas of Europe; the
invincible English infantry rose, and the thunder of the
first cannon proclaimed the end of chivalry; the organization
of the House of Commons and the enlistment of soldiers
for stipend introduced in its full effect the safe policy of
“control of the sovereign by the control of his purse.” The
foundation of Flemish manufactures in England, and the
opening of the New Castle coal trade on the one hand, with
the labors of Wickliffe and Chaucer on the other, were
alone sufficient to make any reign memorable.</p>

<p>It is a matter of wonder that “philosophers of history”
have not made more study of the pregnant events of this
reign. It is a matter of greater wonder that writers of romance
and the drama have not more utilized its highly-colored
scenes; the reigns of John and Richard II, which
Shakspere seized as food for his pen, seem tame in the comparison—the
more so because Froissart’s minute and picturesque
“Chronicles” have preserved a wealth of material
of these events ready to the modern adapter’s hand. This
variety of strong situations should have half a dozen “pictures”
instead of one. Perhaps we can “photograph them
down” into a group of seven vignettes for our one “Picture.”</p>

<p>First shows us Edward, the boy of ten years, taken by his
mother to her brother’s court at Paris and there made the
unwitting tool to work the dethronement and death of his
father (Edward II). His mother has sold his hand in marriage
to the Count of Hainault’s infant daughter for troops
to invade England withal. He becomes nominal king at
the age of fifteen, but his mother and her brilliantly bad
paramour, Mortimer, are the real rulers of England. His
luckless Scotch campaign should be seen, in which his army
was wasted and used up without a blow being struck, because
the Scotch on their Highland ponies, with a bag of oatmeal
dough and a pan-cake griddle at their saddles, needed
no base of supplies, and just starved out and tired out the
richly equipped English army—Isabella and Mortimer plotting
the whole thing to ruin the young king’s popularity
and avert the catastrophe which their black prophetic souls
but too surely anticipated. For there is Nottingham Castle,
the home of the two conspirators. The guards are changed
every night and the keys kept under the queen’s pillow;
and no nobleman is allowed to bring his retinue nearer than
five miles from the walls. Good reason have they to be
thus careful and suspicious after their five years of riot and
usurpation; but their care avails not. The king is twenty
years old and the only man in England capable of delivering
her. We can see to this day the underground passage beneath
the castle walls, where Edward and his few trusted
knights went in and burst open Mortimer’s bed-room,
where he was himself plotting the death of Edward. Comes
the queen rushing in, <i>en déshabillé</i>, screaming, “Do not
hurt my darling Mortimer!” Mortimer goes to the block,
nevertheless; and the scene closes with the guilty queen’s
agony for the loss of the only love of her unhappy life, her
succeeding years of alternate brooding and raving, while all
Europe is ringing with the feats of her son and grandson,
(the Black Prince), not one ray of which glory penetrated
the gloom of her solitary mourning over a lost and guilty
passion. Is not this opening picture of the reign sufficiently
tragic?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Next we should have the first exhibitions of the equally
unholy passion of Edward for foreign conquest. His intrigues
in the Netherlands for the invasion of France are a
study in early diplomacy. A foremost figure in the scene
is the remarkable “Brewer of Ghent,” de Artevelde, whose
romantic career and tragic death at the hands of the people
he most loved and benefited, because they resented his
devotion to Edward, “read like a novel.” Here appear,
too, the sturdy burghers of the Netherlands, painted by
Motley’s matchless pen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Commerce plucks up half drowned Holland by the locks and
pours gold into her lap. Fishermen and river raftsmen become
ocean adventurers and merchant princes. Flemish weavers become
mighty manufacturers. Armies of workmen, fifty thousand
strong, tramp through the swarming streets. Silk-makers, clothiers,
brewers, become the gossips of kings, lend their royal gossips vast
sums and burn the royal notes of hand in fires of cinnamon wood.
Wealth brings strength, strength confidence. Learning to handle
cross-bow and dagger, the burghers fear less the baronial sword,
finding that their own will cut as well, seeing that great armies—flowers
of chivalry—can ride away before them fast enough at battles
of spears and other encounters.... And so, struggling along their
appointed path, making cloth, making money, making treaties with
great kingdoms, making war by land and sea, ringing great bells,
waving great banners, these insolent, boisterous burghers accomplish
their work.”</p></div>

<p>These burghers took all Edward’s money for fighting and
did not fight. From three invasions of France their armies
came back with whole skins and full pockets, until Edward
was beggared, his crown jewels pawned, his estates mortgaged,
and he at last obliged to give hostages to the
thrifty Dutchmen for payment of their claims.</p>

<p>But, three things resulted: (1) “The Brewer of Ghent”
advising it, Edward laid claim to the throne of France as
next in succession by his mother’s prior right, and thus began
the Hundred Years’ War, of great portent to both countries.
(2) Edward and his queen, Phillippa of Hainault,
transplanted colonies of Flemish manufacturers to England,
and laid the foundation of her wealth and independence.
(3) Edward’s necessity proved England’s opportunity, and
every appropriation for his wars was the occasion of new
demands for parliamentary privilege and popular rights.</p>

<p>This vignette closes with the great naval battle off Sluys
(June 24, 1340), so quaintly described by Froissart; in which
we have the strange spectacle of iron-clad French knights
fighting on shipboard, sturdy English sailors boarding and
incontinently pitching them into the sea, where, like Falstaff,
they “have a kind of alacrity in sinking,”—the result
being a victory so striking that it “made the Channel an
English lake for two hundred years,” and a calamity so
complete that no one dared to break the news to the French
king, and so they set the court fools to berating in his
presence “the cowardly English who dared not jump into
the sea as your majesty’s soldiers did.” This victory redeemed
Edward’s military renown, and began to stir the
slow blood of England at last. The idea of annexing
France, which had so long regarded England as only a
Norman-French colony, began to take a hold on all classes.</p>

<p>The third scene should open with the little wars in Little
Britain, the “wars of the two Janes,” wives of the dead
dukes of Brittany, England and France aiding respective
sides. Jane de Montfort’s heroic defense of Hennebon; her
promise to her despairing garrison to surrender within three
days should not the English succor arrive; her discovery of
the English fleet in the offing at day-break of the third day;
and how she came down from the walls after her allies had
beaten and driven off the French and “kissed Sir Walter
Manny and all his knights like a noble and valiant dame;”
and then her subsequent naval victory in the channel, when
she stood on the deck of her flag-ship, in complete armor,
and vanquished her assailants—all this was just the thing
to “fire the hearts” of English chivalry. It only needed in
addition the promise of unlimited booty to raise an army of
English yeomen—not of Dutch burghers—for the invasion
of France (1346). The Norman spoliation is requited with
interest after two hundred and eighty years; booty and prisoners
are sent home by the ship load; the very hostlers of
Edward’s army wear velvets and fine furs every day. Now
we come to the wonderful battle of Cressy—more full of romantic
incident than any other of modern times, save possibly
that of Poictiers, its companion-piece, in the same
reign. On the English side 7,000 jaded, retreating men—on
the French, 60,000 of the best and freshest recruits. But
this handful of men, untitled and unarmored, shall overthrow
that host of steel-clad warriors, with genealogies as
long as their lances, and an ancient culture of arms as useless
as their metal overcoats before the English yeomen, in
their buff and green jerkins. Here the peal of the new
bombards—“the thunder of God,” the French called it—also
told of a new order of war. The world had moved and
the French had not discovered it; while the English had,
for they moved it! The picture is full of incident. There
stands Edward, on the hill by the windmill, refusing to send
reinforcements to the beset Black Prince. “Let the boy win
his spurs. This shall be his victory.” Over here is the brave,
blind, old king of Bohemia, who has heard the battle is
going badly, and he insists on being led into the fray where
he may strike one blow for France and honor, and is struck
down. <i>Ich dien</i><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> is blazoned on his crest—a motto which an
admiring and commiserating foe is to take up and fulfill in
proud humility, a young warrior of sixteen years—</p>

<p>The slaughter of thirty thousand French—Edward had
them carefully counted—by this handful of English made
French prowess forever after despised in the homes and
market-places of England.</p>

<p>The next condensed picture is of the siege of Calais. An
English city springs up around the doomed fortress, and for
a year the English trade, feast, game and tourney before the
starving garrison. Scotland thinks this a good time to
strike England. Queen Phillippa is anon in the field with
an English army, and at Nevill’s Cross (October, 1346) there
is another exhibition of Amazonian chivalry. King David
of Scotland is taken prisoner and by a common soldier,
plain John Copeland, as if everything must be extraordinary
and strange. John hurries his royal prize away to the castle
of Ogle, and sturdily refuses to give him up to the queen
or to any man but King Edward himself. Just the same
John was knighted and rewarded; he would have lost his
head in any other country. Phillippa goes happy enough
over to Calais to spend Christmas and receive the plaudits
of Europe and of her lord, which she thought more of. We
must take in Froissart’s fancy sketch of the surrender of
Calais. The six wealthy burghers voluntarily march out,
barefooted, in their shirts, halters about their necks, to die
vicariously for the rest of the Calaisians; at the pitiful sight
all the English generals intercede with Edward for mercy,
but he will not; the queen goes on her knees and pleads so
eloquently that the stoutest warriors drop surreptitious
tears; the king, with recollections of Nevill’s Cross and the
anticipation of another royal child soon to come, can not
withstand this, and he says, rather ungraciously, he wishes
the queen had been farther away that day, but he supposes
she will have it so; and she gives the six citizens each his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
life, his liberty, a good suit of clothes and a banquet—the
last being esteemed not the least of the gifts after their long
diet on dogs and horses. All this dear old Froissart tells,
and it does not impair its acceptation in history that he
evolved the whole incident from his inner consciousness—any
more than does the fact that good parson Weems invented
the incident of George Washington and the cherry
tree injure that story’s currency. In fact, sober history
of those times is more marvelous than anything that even
the imaginative Froissart could invent. Calais remained an
English stronghold and base of English operations in
France for two hundred years.</p>

<p>It is now 1347, and all England gives itself up to months
of festivity, and patting its own back for its French feats.
There are brilliant tournaments and balls, in which the
captive king of Scotland and captive French nobles take
part as heartily as if they were victors. The Noble Order
of the Garter is established with imposing ritual and brilliant
festivities, and St. George becomes England’s titular
saint. Now occurs Edward’s attempted intrigue with the
Countess of Salisbury, who is as wise, brave and pure as
she is beautiful. The noble part she played makes her, in our
eyes, a greater heroine than Phillippa and “the two Janes.”
She taught Edward such a lesson of propriety that he was
able to turn her own confusion at a court ball into a lesson
in modesty to the tittering lords and ladies, as he clasped
the lost garter on his own knee and said, “<i>Evil be to him
who evil thinks</i>.” And so it comes that the highest order of
English nobility and the noble motto on her coat of arms
commemorates a pure woman’s holding fast to her integrity.
Is not this the best of all the vignettes?</p>

<p>But there is an awfully dark background to it. A rude
stop was put to all these rejoicings by the Black Death
(1348-50). This Chinese epidemic swept desolation over all
Europe. One-third of the population of England was carried
off; half the people of London died, and it was difficult
to find places of burial. The king’s daughter was one of
its victims, and her death took place while she was <i>en route</i>
to Spain to be married; she was buried in the church she
was to have been married in. The loss of laborers and
beasts was so great that famine was added to pestilence.
But these dreadful dispensations contributed to the overthrow
of slavery and hastened the downfall of the Plantagenets.
To counteract the effects of the scarcity of help the
Statute of Laborers was passed, a law which attempted to
fix the price of labor and to prevent villeins leaving their
masters. This act was at the bottom of Wat Tyler’s rebellion
in the next reign, and that was the beginning of the
end of slavery. The revolt of the laboring classes proved a
powerful aid to the spread of Lollardism, and that was the
beginning of the Reformation. Thus do remote blessings
flow from dark and inscrutable causes.</p>

<p>A more resplendent scene follows, by way of contrast
again: The wonderful battle of Poictiers (September 19,
1356), in the heart of France, whither the Black Prince has
recklessly pushed his maraudings. Here ten thousand
English defeated sixty thousand French, and took the
French king, John, prisoner. This completed the humiliation
of France, and “she found in her desolation a miserable
defence against invasion.” King John was borne to
London in honor—for the chivalrous prince would not triumph
over his captive, and humbly waited on him at
table as his superior in rank. Then did his motto, <i>Ich
dien</i>, shine brightly.</p>

<p>Another contrast: “Last scene of all that ends this
strange, eventful history is second childishness and mere
oblivion” to honor and fame on the part of Edward III.
Phillippa was dead. The Black Prince had died, his last
battle being disgraced by an inhuman slaughter of all his
prisoners. The great warrior king in his dotage is the degraded
creature of wicked Alice Perrers. Faction and contention
rule at court, and discontent is in the land. The
old king is on his death-bed. Alice Perrers hastily gathers
her wealth, seizes the king’s jewels, even strips the rings
from his fingers, and flees. The servants rifle the palace,
and the mighty conqueror is left to meet a mightier—alone.
Thus a wandering friar finds the apartments deserted, the
doors standing open, and a wasted, gray old man dying
alone.</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shrunk to this little measure?”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The true glory of the reign remains to be told. Wickliffe’s
brave revolt against Rome called to life the love of
religious liberty there was in English character, and it
never went out again even before the fires of persecution;
while Chaucer called to life the hidden riches of the old-new
English tongue, and the revelation drove the Norman
speech, the last relic of England’s subjugation, out of court,
school, and Parliament, in a statute formally recognizing
the King’s English. The complete organization of the
House of Commons adds another land-mark of the world’s
progress.</p>

<p>Thus the chief glories of Edward Third’s time were not of
his securing or voluntary promoting, and the resulting advantages
to the world can hardly be in their fullness ascribed
to any direct human agency. To whose, then?</p>

<p>“All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord
weigheth the spirits. Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy
thoughts shall be established.”</p></div>

<p>The first of these two verses tells how a man goes wrong,
and the second how he may be set right again. He is led
into error by doing what pleases himself; the rule for recovery
is to commit the works to the Lord, and see that they
are such as will please him. If we weigh our thoughts and
actions in the balances of our own desires, we shall inevitably
go astray; if we lay them before God, and submit to his
pleasure, we shall be guided into truth and righteousness.</p>

<p>Such is the purport of the two verses in general; attend
now to the particulars in detail: “All the ways of a man
are clean in his own eyes.” To a superficial observer this
declaration may seem inconsistent with experience; but he
who wrote these words has fathomed fully the deep things
of a human spirit. As a general rule, men do the things
which they think right, and think the things right which
themselves do. Not many men do what they think evil,
and while they think it evil. The acts may be obviously
evil, but the actor persuades himself of the contrary, at least
until they are done. There is an amazing power of self-deception
in a human heart. It is deceitful above all things.
It is beyond conception cunning in making that appear right
which is felt pleasant. Some, we confess, are so hardened,
that they sin in the face of conscience, and over its neck;
but for one bold, bad man, who treads on an awakened conscience
in order to reach the gratification of his lust, there
are ten cowards who drug the watcher into slumber, that
they may sin in peace. As a general rule, it may be safely
said, if you did not think the act innocent, you would not
do it; but when you have a strong inclination to do it, you
soon find means to persuade yourself that it is innocent.
After all, the real motive power that keeps the wheels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
human life going round is this:—Men like the things that
they do, and do the things that they like. In his own eyes
a man’s ways are clean: if he saw them filthy, he would
not walk in them. But when he desires to walk in a particular
way, he soon begins to count it clean, in order that
he may peacefully walk in it.</p>

<p>In his <i>own eyes</i>: Mark the meaning of these words. Be
not deceived; God is not mocked. Eyes other than his own
are witnessing all the life-course of a man. The eyes of the
Lord are in every place. He does not adopt our inclination
as the standard of right and wrong, and he will not borrow
our balances to determine his own judgment in that day.
“The Lord weigheth the spirits.” Not a thought, not a motive,
trembles in the breast which he does not weigh; more
evidently, though not more surely, are the gross and palpable
deeds of our life open before him! He has a balance
nice enough to weigh motives—the animating soul of our
actions; our actions themselves will not escape his scrutiny.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to any “work” we should weigh it, while
yet it is a “spirit” unembodied, in the balances which will
be used in the judgment of the great day. Letters are
charged in the postoffice according to their weight. I have
written and sealed a letter consisting of several sheets; I
desire that it should pass; I think that it will; but I know
well that it will not be allowed to pass because I desire that
it should, or think that it will; I know well it will be tested
by imperial weights and imperial laws. Before I plunge it beyond
my reach, under the control of the public authorities, I
place it on a balance which stands on the desk before me—a
balance not constructed to please my desires, but honestly
adjusted to the legal standard. I weigh it there, and check
it myself by the very rules which the government will apply.
The children of this world are wise for their own interests.
We do not shut our eyes, and cheat ourselves as to
temporal things and human governments; why should we
attempt to deceive where detection is certain and retribution
complete? On the table before you lies the very balance
in which the Ruler of heaven and earth will weigh both
the body of the act and the motive, the soul that inspires
it. Weigh your purposes in this balance before you launch
them forth in action. The man’s ways are unclean, although,
through a deceitful heart, they are clean in his own
eyes; by what means, therefore, “shall a young man cleanse
his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word”
(Ps. cxix:9).</p>

<p>A most interesting practical rule is laid down as applicable
to the case—“Commit thy works unto the Lord;” and a
promise follows it—“Thy thoughts shall be established.”
It is a common and a sound advice, to ask counsel of the
Lord before undertaking any work. Here we have the
counterpart lesson equally precious—commit the work to
the Lord, after it is done. The Hebrew idiom gives peculiar
emphasis to the precept—Roll it over on Jehovah. Mark
the beautiful reciprocity of the two, and how they constitute
a circle between them. While the act is yet in embryo
as a purpose in your mind, ask counsel of the Lord, that it
may either be crushed in the birth or embodied in righteousness.
When it is embodied, bring the work back to the
Lord, and give it over into his hands as the fruit of the
thought which you besought him to inspire; give it over
into his hands as an offering which he may accept, an instrument
which he may employ. Bring the work, when it
is done, to the Lord; and what will follow?—“Thy thoughts
shall be established.” Bring back the actions of your life
to God, one by one, after they are done, and thereby the
purposes of your heart will be made pure and steadfast; the
evil will be chased away like smoke before the wind, and
the good will be executed in spite of all opposition; for
“when a man’s ways please the Lord, he maketh even his
enemies to be at peace with him.”</p>

<p>A boy, while his stock of experience is yet small, is employed
by his father to lend assistance in certain mechanical
operations. Pleased to think himself useful, he bounds
into the work with heart and hand; but during the process,
he has many errands to his father. At the first he runs to
ask his father how he ought to begin; and when he has
done a little, he carries the work to his father, fondly expecting
approval, and asking further instructions. Oh,
when will the children of God in the regeneration experience
and manifest the same spirit of adoption which animates
dear children as an instinct of nature toward fathers
of their flesh! These two rules, following each other in a
circle, would make the outspread field of a Christian’s life
sunny, and green, and fruitful, as the arching of the solid
system brightens and fertilizes the earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps this latter hemisphere of duty’s revolving circle
is the more difficult of the two. Perhaps most professing
Christians find it easier to go to God beforehand, asking
what they should do, than to return to him afterward to
place their work in his hands. This may in part account
for the want of answer to prayer,—at least the want of a
knowledge that prayer has been answered. If you do not
complete the circle, your message by telegraph will never
reach its destination, and no answer will return. We send
in earnest prayer for direction, and thereafter go into the
world of action; but if we do not bring the action back to
God, the circle of the supplication is not completed. The
prayer does not reach the throne; the message acknowledging
it comes not back to the suppliant’s heart. To bring all
the works to the Lord would be in the character of a dear
child: it would please the Father. A young man came to
his father, and received instructions as to his employment
for the day. “Go work in my vineyard,” was the parent’s
command. “I go, sir,” was the ready answer of the son.
Thus far, all was well; but the deed that followed was disobedience.
The son went not to work in the father’s vineyard;
but we do not learn that he came back in the evening to tell
his father what he had done. To have done so would either
have kept him right, or corrected him for doing wrong.</p>

<p>But some of the works are evil, and how could you dare
to roll these over on the Lord? Ah! there lies the power of
this practical rule. If it were our fixed and unvarying practice
to bring all our works and lay them into God’s hands,
we would not dare to do any except those that he would
smile upon. But others, though not positively evil, may be
of trifling importance, and the doer may decline to bring
them to the King, not because they are impure, but because
they are insignificant. The spirit of bondage betrays itself
here, and not the spirit of adoption. They are small; they
are affairs of children; trouble not the Master. Ah! this
adviser is of the earth, earthy: he knows not the Master’s
mind. The Master himself has spoken to the point: “Suffer
the little children to come unto me, and forbid them
not.” Be assured, little children, whether in the natural
family of man or the spiritual family of God, act in character.
There is no hypocrisy about them. The things they
bring are little things. Children speak as children, yet he
does not beckon them away: he rebukes those who would.
He welcomes and blesses the little ones. Nay, more; he
tells us plainly that we must be like them ere we enter his
kingdom. Like little children without hypocrisy bring all
your affairs to him, and abandon those that he would grieve
to look upon. Bring to him all the works that you do, and
you will not do any that you could not bring to him.</p>

<p>“When a man’s ways please the Lord, he maketh even
his enemies to be at peace with him” (ver. 7). There is, it
seems, such a thing as pleasing God. If it could not exist
on earth, it would not be named from heaven. Even to try
this is a most valuable exercise. There would be more sunlight
in a believer’s life if he could leave the dull negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
fear of judgment far behind as a motive of action, and bound
forward into the glad positive, a hopeful effort to please
God. “Without faith it is impossible to please him” (Heb.
xi: 6); therefore with faith it is possible. “They that are in
the flesh cannot please God;” therefore they that are in the
Spirit can. In this aspect of a believer’s course, as in all
others, Jesus has left us an example that we should follow
his steps: “I do always those things that please him” (John
viii: 29). The glad obedience of the saved should not be
thought inconsistent with the simple trust of the sinful. A
true disciple is zealous of good works; it is a spurious faith
that is jealous of them. Those who, being justified by faith,
are most deeply conscious that their works are worthless,
strive most earnestly to do worthy works.</p>

<p>This, like that which enjoins obedience to parents, is a
commandment “with promise.” When your ways please
God, he will make even your enemies to be at peace with you.
This is one of two principles that stand together in the
word, and act together in the divine administration; its
counterpart and complement is, “If any man will live godly
in Christ Jesus, he must suffer persecution.” They seem
opposite, yet, like night and day, summer and winter, they
both proceed from the same God, and work together for good
to his people. It is true that the mighty of the earth are
overawed by goodness; and it is also true that likeness to
the Lord exposes the disciple to the persecution which his
Master endured. Both are best: neither could be wanted. If
the principle that goodness exposes to persecution prevailed
everywhere and always, the spirit would fail before him and
the souls which he has made. Again, if the principle that
goodness conciliates the favor of the world prevailed every
where and always, discipline would be done, and the service
of God would degenerate into mercenary self-interest.
If the good received only and always persecution for their
goodness, their life could not endure, and the generation of
the righteous would become extinct: if the good received
only and always favor from men, their spiritual life would
be overlaid, and choked in the thick folds of worldly prosperity.
A beautiful balance of opposites is employed to produce
one grand result. It is like the balance of antagonist
forces, which keeps the planets in their places, and maintains
the harmony of the universe. Temporal prosperity
and temporal distress, the world’s friendship and its enmity,
are both formidable to the children of God. Our Father in
heaven, guarding against the danger on either side, employs
the two reciprocally to hold each other in check. Human
applause on this side is a dangerous enemy, and it is made
harmless by the measure of persecution which the godly
must endure: on the other side, the enmity of a whole
world is a weight under which the strongest would at last
succumb; but it is made harmless by the opposite law,—the
law by which true goodness conciliates favor even in
an evil world. A Christian in the world is like a human
body in the sea,—there is a tendency to sink and a tendency
to swim. A very small force in either direction will turn
the scale. Our Father in heaven holds the elements of
nature and the passions of men at his own disposal: his
children need not fear, for he keeps the balance in his own
hands.</p>

<h4><a id="THREE_DISPENSATIONS_IN_HISTORY_AND_IN_THE_SOUL"></a>THREE DISPENSATIONS IN HISTORY AND IN THE SOUL.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></h4>

<p class='center'>By <span class="smcap">Bishop</span> F. D. HUNTINGTON, D.D.</p>

<p>The spiritual growth of mankind has proceeded through
three great stages. Each of these has been marked by the
evolution of one predominating element, or salient principle
of religious action. On examination, we shall be able to
discover an impressive correspondence between these successive
epochs in the history of humanity at large, and the
process of life in a well-disciplined, Christianized individual.
This analogy is so thickly set with points of interest,
as well as so fruitful of practical suggestions touching right
religious ideas, and right living, that I shall let it fix the
form, and be the subject of the discourse. That subject is:
<i>The threefold discipline of our spiritual experience, as compared
with the threefold order in the expanding nurture of
the human family</i>.</p>

<p>The three Biblical dispensations are types of three great
principles of conduct, or rather three schools of religious
culture, under which we must pass as persons, just as the
race has passed in history, before we can be built up into the
symmetrical stature of a Christian maturity.</p>

<p>I. First, was the dispensation of natural religious feeling.
The race was in childhood. It acted from impulse. It
obeyed no written code of moral regulations, but, so far as
its life was right, it either followed some free religious instincts,
or else depended on direct intimations from the
Deity, directing or forbidding each specific deed. The man
chosen as the representative of this period was Abraham.
The record of it is the book of Genesis. That writing is the
first grand chapter in the biography of man; and its very
literary structure—so dramatic in contents, and so lyrical
in expression, so careless of the rules of art, so abounding in
personal details, and graphic groupings of incident; so like
a child’s story in its sublime simplicity—answers to the
spontaneous period it pictures. “The patriarchal age” we
call it. The term itself intimates rude, unorganized politics;
the head of each family being the legislator for his
tribe. But, in the absence of systematic statutes, every
man, by a liberty so large as to burst often into license, was
likely to do very much what was right in his own eyes. If
he had strong passions, he would be a sensualist, like
Shechem, or a petty tyrant, like Laban. If he were constitutionally
gentle, he would be an inoffensive shepherd, like
Lot. Such were the first two brothers. Cain’s jealousy
made him a murderer; Abel was peaceable, kept sheep, and
the only voice he lifted up against outrage, was when his
blood cried from the ground. Some of these nomadic people,
having devout temperaments, “called upon the name of
the Lord,” we are told, like Enoch and Noah. Others were
bloated giants, mighty men in animal propensities, gross
and licentious, given to promiscuous marriages; so that
presently God saw that the wickedness was so great, and
the imaginations of men’s hearts were so evil, that he must
wash the unclean earth with a deluge. But there was no
permanent restraining power; no fixed standard of judicial
command; and so, when the flood dried, the tide of sin set
in again, streaked only with some veins of nobleness. On
the plains of Shinar pride fancied that it could build a tower
that should overtop the All-seeing Providence; and it had
to be humbled by a confusion of tongues, scattering the
builders. Even Noah, a just man for his times, so pure in
<i>that</i> comparison, that he was carried over on the waves from
a drowned generation, to install a new one, had scarcely
seen the many-colored splendors of the promise in the rainbow,
before he was drunken of overmuch wine. Abraham
himself, so full of trust that his trust finally saved him;
strong enough in the power of it to lay his son on an altar;
at an earlier age stained his tongue with a cowardly falsehood,
calling his wife his sister for safety’s sake—first
pattern of politicians of mere expediency—and was rebuked
for it by a Pharaoh, who had seen less of the heavenly
visions than he. Sodom, with its indescribable pollutions,
was not far from Beth-el—house of God. Jacob
received a revelation from opened heavens; yet he over-reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
his brother to appropriate the family blessing, and
defraud his father-in-law.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this patriarchal era, reaching
from Adam to Joseph, and covering, by the common computation,
twenty-three hundred years, there were beautiful
virtues, flowering into the light by the spontaneous energy
of nature, but poisoned in many spots by the slime of sensuality.
The human stock threw out its forms of life with a
certain negligence, as the prodigal force of nature does her
forests—as a boy swings his limbs in the open air. There
were heroic acts; but they were dispersed over intervals,
with dismal contrasts of meanness and cowardice between.
There were ardent prayers; but foul passions often
met and put to flight the descending hosts of the angels of
God. Character needed a staunch vertebral column to
secure its uprightness. No permanent sanction lent impregnability
to good impulses. Even the saint, whose
spirit rose nearest to heaven, walked on the verge of some
abyss of shame. For though Abraham believed, Moses had
not yet legislated, nor Christ died.</p>

<p>Corresponding, now, to this impulsive religious age of
the race, is the natural state of the individual. It is the
condition we are born into, and the multitudes never pass
beyond it, because they are never renewed, or made Christian.
Morally they are children all their lives. Bad dispositions
mix with good; one moment holy aspirations; the
next a flagrant immorality. What is wanting is a second
birth of spiritual conviction. Conduct is not brought to the
bar of a governmental examination, and judged by an unbending
principle. Temptation is too much for this feeble,
capricious piety. Nature, true enough, is always interesting;
and spontaneous products may be beautiful. But
man, with his free agency, beset before and behind by evil,
is not like a lily growing under God’s sun and dew, with
no sin to deform its grace or stain its coloring; he is not
like the innocent architecture of a cloud, shaped by the
fantastic caprices of the summer wind; nor yet like the
aimless statuary of the sea-shore, sculptured by the pliant
chisel of the wave. He has to contend, struggle, resist.
He is tried, enticed, besieged. Satan creeps anew with
every new-born child into the Eden of the heart, and flaming
swords are presently planted on its gates, proclaiming—no
return <i>that way</i> to innocence. The natural religion,
of which modern mystics are so fond, and modern peripatetics
prattle, is not enough for him. It might possibly answer
in the woods, unless this feeble pantheism would substitute
artistic ecstacy for worship, and moonlight for the
sun, that flashes down the glories of revelations; or in some
solitary cell, though even there monk and hermit have
often found the snare of impure imaginations spread too
cunningly for it. But let the boy go to the shop, and the
girl to school; let the young man travel to the city, and the
young woman lend her ears to the flatteries of that silver-tongued
sorceress, Society; and all this natural piety is
like a silken thread held over a blazing furnace. We may
put ourselves at ease, fancy we shall fare well enough under
so kind a Father; come out comfortably at last; there
is such tender pity in the skies. But the dispelling of that
delusion will be the sharp word out of the throne of judgment—“Depart
from me, I never knew you.” No Babel of
refuge will be built to the top. No friendly intervention
will avert the perdition of the Sodom in the heart. No
Tamar of custom will cajole with her coquetry the ancient
and everlasting justice. No thrifty leagues of a low commercial
instinct, postponing conscience to the arithmetic
of traffic—no corrupt political majorities, subscribing patriotic
manifestoes as stock for party or private dividends,
though they be as eleven against one, and though they
piously profess to be sons of Israel by church subscriptions,
shall buy national prosperity by their brother Joseph’s blood.</p>

<p>There is often a vague assumption that certain principles
of natural right, evolved and compacted by ethical science,
might save our social state. But, remember that society,
without Christ, in its philosophy, its literature, its art, its
morals, obeyed a law of deterioration and decay. Without
him, it would have been sinking still. Instead of the
Christian justice that hangs its balances over our seats of
lawful trade to-day, we should have not even Punic faith;
but something more treacherous than that—not even the
hesitating Roman honesty, but a zone of restraint more
dissolute than the Corinthian, and principles looser than
the Spartan’s. Instead of a respected merchant, or a steady
mechanic, going out to his business to-morrow, amid a
public order that Christ has organized, might have been
seen a barbarian, with the concentrated falsity of a hundred
Arabs, waking into a world convulsed with perpetual
anarchy, or skulking away to transact his base affairs in a
worse than Circassian mart. We may baptize the interesting
displays of our intermittent virtue with a Christian
name; but they may yet contain no quality of Christ’s
peculiar sanctity. They may leave human life quite untouched
by that unrivaled glory, however bright their
transient beam. They are not redolent of the New Testament.
Their uprightness does not bear the sanction of the
Sermon on the Mount. Their slender rectitude is not the
principle that treats men justly because they are God’s
children, which was the law of Christ’s great honesty.
Their kindness is not the sweet charity of the beatitudes.
Their moderation is not guarded by those majestic warders,
reverence for God, and a Savior’s love. Nor is their worship,
if they adore at all, fervent with the prayers of Olivet
and Gethsemane.</p>

<p>And as the first dispensation ended in a slavery in Egypt,
or broods darkly over pagan nations waiting to be brought
nigh by the blood of Christ to this hour, so the lawless motions
of every self-guided will end in a servitude to some
Pharaoh in the members that cries aloud for emancipation—a
settled alienation from the household of the good.</p>

<h3>[<i><a id="March_18"></a>March 18.</i>]</h3>

<h4>THREE DISPENSATIONS.</h4>

<p>Next after this impulsive or spontaneous period, which is
the period of childhood, comes the legal or judicial—a second
stage in the history of the religious consciousness.
Moses, the law-giver, is its representative. From this crisis,
the chief significance of the world’s religious experience is
concentrated, for some sixteen hundred years, in Judea, and
human progress runs on through the channel of Hebrew
nationality. Other families have wandered off into hopeless
idolatries. The religion of instinct has found its appropriate
termination in a degraded Egyptian priesthood,
mixing civil despotism with the incantations of an impure
mythology.</p>

<p>And now, God calls up Moses <i>out</i> of his miserable oppression
into the summit of Sinai, and appoints him the head
of the second august human epoch. A period of laws, after
instinct, begins. Instinct must be curbed, for it has done
mischief enough. Impulse must be subjected to principle,
for it has proved itself insufficient alone. There must be
positive command, controlling wayward inclinations.
“Thou shalt,” and “Thou shalt not,” are the watchwords.
It is an age of obedience. Ceremonies and ordinances are
set up to bring the wild will under discipline. And the better
to secure exact obedience, a visible system of formal observances
is announced—so many sacrifices every day, and
so many meat-offerings, drink-offerings, cattle, doves, fruits,
cakes, for every sacrifice. To withstand the surrounding
seductions of nations still steeped in the vices of their natural
propensities, a scheme of coercive restraints comes in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
The people must have multiplied festivals, jubilees, national
gatherings, regularly kept, and by divine appointment. To
draw them, there is a gorgeous temple with an imposing altar,
a tabernacle, a covenant, a shekinah lighted from
heaven, a priesthood clad in the splendid garments, and all
the superb apparatus of a magnificent ritual. Even the
daily habits, materials of common dress, qualities of food
and kinds of flesh, are all to be regulated in detail by specific
statutes. Law reaches down to determine the most
minute particulars—the cleansing of houses, the shape of the
beard, the sowing of the field—all having reference to neighboring
idolatrous usages, of which these twelve tribes must,
by all means, be kept clear. And for the breach of every
law, from greatest to least, there must be penalty. That
part of human nature, that terror and dread appeal to, is
addressed. On the transgressor woe is denounced. There
is a Mount Ebal, full of menacing curses, as well as a Gerizim
pledged to blessings. Smoke, earthquakes, thunders
and lightnings, marshaling their awful pageant about Sinai
when the law was given, only prefigured punishments that
should always torment the disobedient. And, accordingly,
down through all the Hebrew fortunes, while prophets were
set to admonish and call back the rebellious, the great staple
of Israelitish history was, the divine chastisement that
followed violations of law, and the prosperity that rewarded
its observance. Sieges and campaigns, conquests and captivities,
judges and kings, Joshua, Gideon, and Ezra, David,
Saul, and Rehoboam—all were of less consequence, as events,
or as individuals, than as instruments of that mighty, organized
power <i>lying behind them—Moses and the law</i>.</p>

<p>So with all of us; there comes a time when we feel that
we cannot act by inclination, but must follow law. The
principle of duty is that law. Babyhood is past, and its instincts
suffice us no longer. To do as we like, would still
be pleasant; but it is dangerous and false. We become
stewards and <i>must</i> give account of our stewardship. Life
has put its harness upon us, and we must work in it. Passions
have sprung up, and conflicts have commenced within
us, that make impulse an unsafe guide. We find a meaning
in that hard word <i>must</i>. We are free to do as we will, and
yet we feel somehow bound under God’s necessity. It begins
to be evident that as sure as a stone falls or fire burns,
sin will bring trouble; indulgence, pain; impiety, remorse;
dissipation, disease; dishonesty, infamy. The spendthrift
<i>must</i> be pinched, the fraudulent bargainer lose his soul
though he gain the world, and the false professor be spiritually
damned. Here are laws—laws of the Almighty’s ordaining—laws
that bring retribution. If we would live
peaceably, we must come under them and obey.</p>

<p>Very often it happens that by obeying a law, we acquire
superiority to it. Voluntarily submitting to certain rules
for a time, our virtue is strengthened and finally becomes
independent of them, so that it can go alone. The inebriate
binds himself by a pledge, and thus regains his freedom.
The disciple appoints specific hours for praying, and by that
means gains the devout spirit which breathes a perpetual
aspiration, at last inaugurating a silent converse of the soul
with heaven, as natural as the pulse in the veins. The
methodical division of time for business is only a form of
law, coercing industry and efficiency. Many a man has to
spur his sluggishness, by definite tasks; and many more
would bring nothing to pass, but for fixed methods and seasons.
Without a morning and evening sacrifice, forgetful
worldliness would render poor service to God; and memories,
like Martha, so careful and troubled about many things,
would fail of Mary’s one thing needful. The laying apart of
exact sums for charity has been all that stood between some
men and the doom of avarice; benevolence had to be put
out to school, and philanthropy be drilled into promptitude
like a cadet. Let us not despise law, for every day practical
proofs are scattered before us, that it is a school-master
to lead us to Christ.</p>

<p>Even fear, though fastidious nerves are apt to discredit it
as a lower sentiment, has its office in disciplining thoughtless
and stubborn wills, breaking down pride and prompting
insensibility, till it is ready to hand us over to motives
of a nobler order. There is a meaning in a tradition of an
ancient German prince, who, in early life, was bidden by
an oracle to search out an inscription on a ruined wall which
should prefigure his mortal fate. He found the Latin words,
signifying <i>after six</i>. Supposing they revealed the number
of days he was to live, he gave himself for the six days following
to his hitherto neglected soul, preparing himself to
die. But finding death did not come, he was still held to
his sober resolutions by supposing six weeks were the interpretation;
and then he prolonged his holy life to six months,
and six years. On the first day of the seventh year, by reason
of the excellent manhood into which he had thus formed
his character, he had gained the confidence of the people,
and he found the fulfillment of the ambiguous prophecy, by
being chosen Emperor of Germany. Here is a figure of
common experience. We may conceive it to have been a mere
“spiritual” process, that the prince should have been drawn
to piety, by loving goodness for its own sake. But it was
the timid dread of dying that drew him, and the royal benefactions
of a truly Christian monarch justified the agent.
Have you never known a fever, or an accident, or the incipient
symptoms of a consumption to be the determining cause
that bent the whole current of a life from earthward to
heavenward? Have you never known that a mere dread
of punishment or pain, of hell or disgrace, has stopped the
erring feet of lust, silenced profanity, driven back the Sabbath-breaker?
God is not ashamed to take into the sublime
economy of his purposes these stimulants to virtue; and let
not us, in our puerile conceit, venture to pronounce them
unworthy. Outgrow them if you will, and can; but take
care that you are not found, after all, <i>below</i>, instead of
<i>above</i> the plane of their influence.</p>

<p>For be assured, though we have read the New Testament,
named the name of Jesus, and quite looked down on the
Jews, some of us have not yet climbed up so far as to Moses
and his Jewish law. In the Bible’s older Testament there
are needed examples for us yet. Not all of us have learned
that majestic, unchangeable fact, that God is Sovereign;
nor those related facts that, if we <i>will</i> perpetrate <i>the wrong</i>,
we must suffer the penalty; that we can not dodge the consequences
of what we do; that indolence must sap our
strength; that selfishness must end in wretchedness; that
falsehood is a mint, coining counterfeits that must return
upon our hands; that hypocrisy to-day is disgrace to-morrow.
This is law, everlasting, unrepealable law; and our
poor attempts to resist, or nullify it, avail not so much as a
puff of mortal breath against the gulf stream in the Atlantic.
Blessed will it be for our peace, when we accept it, and bow
to it, turning it into a law of liberty.</p>

<p>Remember that the grandest examples of sainthood, or
spiritual life, that the ages have seen, have been souls that
recognized this truth—the firm, Puritanical element, in all
valiant piety; and without it mere amiable religious feeling
will be quite sure to degenerate into sentimentality. We
need to stand compassed about with the terrible splendors
of the mount, and with something of the somber apparatus
of Hebrew commandments, to keep us from falling off into
some impious, Gentile idolatries of the senses. Holy places,
and holy days, and solemn assemblies, still dispense sanctity.
Our appetites have to be hedged about with almost as many
scruples of regimen for Christian moderation’s sake, as the
Jew’s for his monotheism. “We wish,” says some one,
“that it was not so difficult to be good. We wish that we
could be self-indulgent, and yet be good for all that; that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
could idle off our time, and yet be wise for all that.” The
worldling wishes that he could combine his worldliness now
with a heaven hereafter; the voluptuary, that he could have
“the clear eye and the steady hand of the temperate;” the
vain, ambitious, capricious woman, that she could exhibit
the serenity that comes of prayer. But Sinai stands unmoved,
at the outset of every life-journey through the wilderness;
and at the further end, beyond the river, Ebal with
his curses, and Gerizim with its blessings. “Whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>[<i><a id="March_25"></a>March 25.</i>]</h3>

<h4>THREE DISPENSATIONS.</h4>

<p>But there is a third dispensation, profounder and richer
than that of statutes; and, at the head of it, one greater than
Moses. The period of literal commandments was insufficient;
humanity outgrew it. It became a dead profession,
a school of foolish questions, a shelter of hideous hypocrisies.
Lo! the enlarging soul of the race asks a freer, more
sincere, more vital nurture, and it comes. If the simple religious
instincts of Abraham had been accepted for righteousness;
if the law had been given by Moses; grace and
truth enter in by Jesus Christ; grace for the heart, truth for
the understanding; favor for man’s stumbling feet, and
light for his eyes. Christ does not abrogate law, but by his
own life and sacrifice first satisfies its conditions. He says
expressly, “Think not that I came to destroy Moses, but to
fulfill.” The cross does not unbind the cords of accountability,
but tightens and strengthens them rather. The gospel
affords no solvent to disentegrate the commandments;
it only lets “the violated law speak out its thunders” in the
tones of pity. Divine laws never looked so sacred as when
they took sanctity from the redemption of the crucified.</p>

<p>Witness now a new light, “lighting every man that cometh
into the world.” It is the deliverance of the heart. It
is the purifying of the life. It is the sanctification of the
spirit. The law, by which no man living can be justified,
because no man ever yet kept it inviolate; which makes no
allowance for imperfect obedience, and yet never was perfectly
obeyed—which, therefore, is a rule of universal condemnation
when standing alone—this stern, unrelenting law
gives place to a gospel—gladder tidings—a voice that comes
not to condemn but to save, a ministry of mercy, asking
only a penitent spirit that it may offer forgiveness, and only
inward faith changing the motives that it may confer
eternal life.</p>

<p>Law and prophets, then, are not annulled; what they
lacked is supplied. They are absorbed by evangelists.
The gospel takes up all their contents, recasts them, and
quickens them with the vitality of a fresh inspiration.
Moses remains, but only as a servant to Christ. The decalogue
still stands; but the cross stands on a higher pedestal,
invested with a purer glory. Humble Calvary is the
seat of a loftier power than towering Horeb. We must still
be under discipline; but the Lawgiver is lost in the Redeemer.
What <i>was</i> a task is transfigured into a choice.
The drudgery of obedience is beautified into the privilege of
reconciliation. Love has cast out fear. Man no longer
cowers before his sovereign with terror, but pours out his
praises to a Father. The soul is released from the bondage
of a thrall into the liberty of a child. Out of the plodding
routine of mechanical sacrifice, it ascends into spiritual
Joy, where the handwriting of ordinances is done away; the
Great High Priest has ascended once for all into the heavens,
and suffering is willingly borne because it makes the
disciple like the Lord.</p>

<p>Thus the word spoken by the third epoch of religious culture
is not, “Act thy nature out and follow thy lawless impulses”—nor
yet, “Do this circle of outward works, and
then come and claim salvation for thy merits”—but, believe,
first, and then out of thy faith do the righteous
works which thou then canst not but do. Repent of thy
short comings, and be forgiven. Lean on Christ, thy
Savior. Love God, thy Father. Help men, thy brethren.
And come, inherit thy immortal kingdom!</p>

<p>Now, at last, if it only keeps on in the path divinely
marked for it, the soul emerges into that wide fellowship of
Christ—that open hospitality of spiritual freedom, where
the impulse of nature is only guided, not stifled, by law;
where law is ripened and fulfilled into faith. The highest
victory of goodness is union with God. The union comes
only by a Mediator. For reconciliation between finite and
infinite, there must be a Reconciler combining both. The
way to peace lies by Calvary. Humanity realizes its complete
proportions, only by inward membership with him
who fills all the veins of his living body with his blood,
and the chambers of his church with the glory of his presence
to-day. “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved.”</p>

<p>For, observe, by all means, this striking condition pertaining
to the doctrine; that neither of these three stages,
whether of the general or the personal progress, denies, or
cuts off, its predecessor. Nature prepares the way for law—making
the heart <i>restless</i>, by an unsatisfying experiment,
without it. Abraham saw more glorious ages coming than
his own, and the promise given to him and his seed, Emmanuel
accomplished. The law disciplined wayward, uncultured
man, making him ready for the Church that was
to descend “like a bride out of heaven.” Every ordinance
in its ritual was a type; every statute was a prophecy.</p>

<p>All Judaism was prospective. Moses looked forward to
the Messiah. So, in the heart of childhood, there are expectations,
vague and yet brilliant, of the responsible second
stage of manhood; it is too thoughtless yet to look
beyond, to the age of mature Christian holiness. But see,
again, when that second age of stern command and strict
obedience comes, it grows sober and reflective. It feels
heavily that it is not sufficient to itself. It must look longingly
forward for the consolations of the cross. Nature
does not comprehend law, nor law gospel; Abraham Moses,
nor Moses Messiah; but the Son of God understands all,
and the gospel, in its majestic orbit, while embracing law
and nature, transcends them both.</p>

<p>Remember, also, for its practical fruit’s sake, this fact,
that each stage requires fidelity in the preceding. You
must have been true to the better impulses of youth, that
you may be, to the best advantage, a servant of the law of
maturity. You must be faithfully obedient to duty, before
you are fit to be a subject of grace. Do not imagine you
can glide over into the favor of heaven, without first keeping
the commandment. It is a strait gate, and a narrow way
that leads to life. I must be a cheerful servant, before I
can know the joy of adoption, and cry, “Abba, Father.”
Willing to be constrained by the positive precept, I may
hope, by-and-by, for the freedom of a child and heir. Many
things that I would rather not do—irksome to the sluggish
will, hard to the love of ease, offensive to pride, bitter to
selfish pleasure—I must do, before I can ascend to that
sublime self-mastery with Christ, where I shall <i>desire</i> to do
only what I ought. You have seen a seabird, which in
rising from the waves has to run some way with difficulty
upon the water, striking the surface laboriously with its
pinions; but when it has once lifted itself into the upper
air, it balances its flight with a calm motion, and enfranchised
into the freedom of the sky, the slow beat of its
wings are imperceptible. It is by pain and toil <i>under</i> the
commandments, that the soul gets the liberty of its faculties;
but when it has been taken up out of itself by love and
trust, it moves in harmony with God. The law was our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might “be
justified by faith.” But “after that faith is come, we are
no longer under a schoolmaster.” “All things are yours,
and ye are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.” No longer at
Gerizim, nor yet at Jerusalem, but everywhere, we may
worship the Father!</p>

<p>You have seen the religionist of mere passion. That impulsive
temperament is doubtless capable of good services
to the master. But, to that end, the master must have the
reforming of it. That unsteady purpose must be made
steadfast through a thoughtful imitation of the constancy
that said, “Behold, I go up to Jerusalem to be crucified.”
That fluctuating wing of worship must be poised by some
influence from those hills, where whole nights were not too
long for a Redeemer’s prayers. That inexpert swimmer in
the sea of life, now rising, now sinking, and now noisily
splashing the waters, must be schooled by sober experience
to glide onward with a firmer and stiller stroke. Ardor
must be matched with consistency. You are not to be carried
to heaven by a fitful religion, periodically raised from
the dead at seasons of social exhilaration; not by a religion
alive at church, but stagnant in the streets and in the market-places;
not by a religion kindling at some favored hour
of sentimental meditation, only to sink and flicker in the
drudgery of common work. It is to little purpose that we
read, and circulate, and preach the Bible, except all our
reading and all our living gain thereby a more biblical
tone. And it is quite futile that our breasts glow with
some fugitive feeling in the house of God, unless that feeling
dedicates our common dwellings to be all houses of
God.</p>

<p>So have you seen the religious legalist. In business, in the
street, in sanctuaries, at home, you have seen him. In business,
measuring off his righteousness by some sealed measure
of public usage, as mechanically as his merchandise, and
making a label or a dye-stuff his cunning proxy to tell the lie
that some judicial penalty had frightened from his tongue;
disowning no patent obligation, but cheating the customer,
or oppressing the weak, in secret. In the street, wearing an
outside of genial manners, with a frosty temper under it, or
a cloak of propriety with a heart of sin; in the sanctuary, purchasing,
with formal professions, one day, the privilege of an
untroubled self-seeking the other six, or possibly opening
the pew door and the prayer-book here to-day, with the
same hand that will wrong a neighbor to-morrow; and at
home, practicing that reluctant virtue that would hardly
give conjugal affection but for the marriage-bond, and that,
by being exported to another continent, would find a Parisian
atmosphere a solvent of all its scruples. Not descending,
at present, to the depth of depravity, he certainly never
rises to a pure piety. Whatever respectable or admirable
traits you see in him, you miss that distinctive mark which
every eye takes knowledge of as a spiritual consecration.</p>

<p>Engraft, now, on that “wild olive” stock, the sweet juices
of Christian love, drawn from their original stock in Bethlehem,
“of the seed of David and the root of Jesse;” soften
that hard integrity by Christian charity; in place of duty
done from sheer compulsion, put duty done from a willing,
eager, and believing heart. Do this, and thou shalt live.</p>

<p>Abraham, Moses, Christ; impulse, discipline, faith; nature,
law, gospel; instinct, obedience, grace; Mamre, Sinai,
Calvary; this is that divine order—not bound by rigid rules
of chronological succession, but having the free play and
various intershadings of a moral growth—to which we are
to conform our lives. When the “<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>”
shall have controlled our impatient will, our hearts will be
ready to say, “Our Father, who art in heaven!” Seek,
first, after that indwelling goodness that has its fountain in
the center of the soul, and good works will be the constant
stream. Be children of light. Live by the spirit, not the
letter; by faith, not by fear. For you are called to be disciples
of Jesus. Henceforth the Christian is to be known,
and to be saved, not by the hand so much as by the heart;
not by a righteousness that is legal, but spiritual. Let not
your piety be the occasional piety of Rabbinical Sabbaths,
with ghastly intervals of worldliness between, like isolated
springs in a desert of sand; but a piety, whose perennial influence,
like the river that keeps the meadows always
green, shall penetrate and fertilize the whole soil and open
field of your being, and thus make glad the city of your
God. No rich, or beautiful, or excepted life can be had by
us, except Christ be its inspiration. Hope will not reach
up to immortality, except it climb by the cross. Let not
your lives be dead shapes of outward decency—the carved
and gilded wood of an ark and a tabernacle deserted by the
Spirit—but vital branches, filled with leaping and vigorous
currents of holy feeling, on the living vine! “For if any
man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”</p>

<h2><a name="PRACTICE_AND_HABIT" id="PRACTICE_AND_HABIT">PRACTICE AND HABIT.</a></h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By JOHN LOCKE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>John Locke, the author from whose writings we quote the
article below, made his reputation chiefly by his famous essay
on the “Human Understanding.” The article on “Practice
and Habit,” together with “Thoughts and Aphorisms,” by
Jonathan Swift, constitute the “Required Readings” from
English History for the month of March. Swift was famous
alike for his wit, his genius, his love affairs, his political
warfare, “Tale of a Tub,” and other works.</p>


<h4>PRACTICE AND HABIT.</h4>

<p>We are born with faculties and powers capable almost of
anything, such at least as would carry us farther than can
be easily imagined: but it is only the exercise of those powers
which gives us ability and skill in anything, and leads
us toward perfection.</p>

<p>A middle-aged ploughman will scarce ever be brought to
the carriage and language of a gentleman, though his body
be as well proportioned, and his joints as supple, and his
natural parts not any way inferior. The legs of a dancing-master,
and the fingers of a musician, fall, as it were, naturally
without thought or pains, into regular and admirable
motions. Bid them change their parts, and they will
in vain endeavor to produce like motions in the members
not used to them, and it will require length of time and
long practice to attain but some degrees of a like ability.
What incredible and astonishing actions do we find rope-dancers
and tumblers bring their bodies to! not but that
sundry in almost all manual arts are as wonderful; but I
name those which the world takes notice of for such, because,
on that very account, they give money to see them.
All these admired motions, beyond the reach and almost
the conception of unpractised spectators, are nothing but
the mere effects of use and industry in men whose bodies
have nothing peculiar in them from those of the amazed
lookers-on.</p>

<p>As it is in the body, so it is in the mind; practice makes
it what it is; and most even of those excellencies which are
looked on as natural endowments, will be found, when examined
into more narrowly, to be the product of exercise,
and to be raised to that pitch only by repeated actions.
Some men are remarked for pleasantness in raillery, others
for apologues and apposite diverting stories. This is apt to
be taken for the effect of pure nature, and that the rather,
because it is not got by rules, and those who excel in either
of them never purposely set themselves to the study of it as
an art to be learnt. But yet it is true, that at first some
lucky hit which took with somebody, and gained him commendation,
encouraged him to try again, inclined his
thoughts and endeavors that way, till at last he insensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
got a facility in it without perceiving how; and this is attributed
solely to nature, which was much more the effect
of use and practice. I do not deny that natural disposition
may often give the first rise to it; but that never carries a
man far without use and exercise, and it is practice alone that
brings the powers of the mind as well as those of the body
to their perfection. Many a good poetic vein is buried under
a trade, and never produces anything for want of improvement.
We see the ways of discourse and reasoning are very
different, even concerning the same matter, at court and in
the university. And he that will go but from Westminster
Hall to the Exchange will find a different genius and turn
in their ways of talking; and one can not think that all
whose lot fell in the city were born with different parts
from those who were bred at the university or inns of court.</p>

<p>To what purpose all this, but to show that the difference
so observable in men’s understandings and parts does not
arise so much from the natural faculties as acquired habits?
He would be laughed at that should go about to make a fine
dancer out of a country hedger at past fifty. And he will
not have much better success who shall endeavor at that age
to make a man reason well, or speak handsomely, who has
never been used to it, though you should lay before him a
collection of all the best precepts of logic or oratory. Nobody
is made anything by hearing of rules, or laying them
up in his memory; practice must settle the habit of doing
without reflecting on the rule; and you may as well hope to
make a good painter, or musician, extempore, by a lecture
and instruction in the arts of music and painting, as a coherent
thinker, or strict reasoner, by a set of rules, showing
him wherein right reasoning consists.</p>

<p>This being so, that defects and weakness in men’s understandings,
as well as other faculties, come from want of a
right use of their own minds, I am apt to think the fault is
generally mislaid upon nature, and there is often a complaint
of want of parts, when the fault lies in want of a due
improvement of them. We see men frequently dexterous
and sharp enough in making a bargain, who if you reason
with them about matters of religion appear perfectly stupid.</p>

<p>If the men of wit and genius would resolve never to complain
in their works of critics and detractors, the next age
would not know that they ever had any.</p>

<p>Imaginary evils soon become real ones by indulging our
reflections on them, as he who in a melancholy fancy sees
something like a face on the wall or the wainscot can, by
two or three touches with a lead pencil, make it look visible
and agreeing with what he fancied.</p>

<p>Men of great parts are often unfortunate in the management
of public business, because they are apt to go out of
the common road by the quickness of their imagination.
This I once said to my Lord Bolingbroke, and desired he
would observe that the clerks in his office used a sort of
ivory knife with a blunt edge to divide a sheet of paper,
which never failed to cut it even, only requiring a steady
hand; whereas if they should make use of a sharp penknife,
the sharpness would make it often go out of the crease and
disfigure the paper.</p>

<p>“He who does not provide for his own house,” St. Paul
says, “is worse than an infidel;” and I think he who provides
only for his own house is just equal with an infidel.</p>

<p>I never yet knew a wag (as the term is) who was not a
dunce.</p>

<p>When we desire or solicit anything, our minds run wholly
on the good side or circumstances of it; when it is obtained,
our minds run wholly on the bad ones.</p>

<p>The latter part of a wise man’s life is taken up in curing
the follies, prejudices, and false opinions he had contracted
in the former.</p>

<p>Would a writer know how to behave himself with relation
to posterity, let him consider in old books what he finds
that he is glad to know, and what omissions he most laments.</p>

<p>One argument to prove that the common relations of
ghosts and spectres are generally false, may be drawn from
the opinion held that spirits are never seen by more than
one person at a time; that is to say, it seldom happens to
above one person in a company to be possessed with any
high degree of spleen or melancholy.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to observe how free the present age is in
laying taxes on the next: “Future ages shall talk of this;”
“This shall be famous to all posterity:” whereas their time
and thoughts will be taken up about present things, as ours
are now.</p>

<p>I never heard a finer piece of satire against lawyers than
that of astrologers, when they pretend by rules of art to tell
when a suit will end, and whether to the advantage of the
plaintiff or defendant; thus making the matter depend entirely
upon the influence of the stars, without the least regard
to the merits of the cause.</p>

<p>I have known some men possessed of good qualities,
which were very serviceable to others but useless to themselves:
like a sun-dial on the front of a house, to inform the
neighbors and passengers, but not the owner within.</p>

<p>If a man would register all his opinions upon love, politics,
religion, learning, etc., beginning from his youth, and
so go on to old age, what a bundle of inconsistencies and
contradictions would appear at last!</p>

<p>The stoical scheme of supplying our wants by lopping off
our desires, is like cutting off our feet when we want shoes.</p>

<p>The reason why so few marriages are happy is, because
young ladies spend their time in making nets, not in making
cages.</p>

<p>The power of fortune is confessed only by the miserable,
for the happy impute all their success to prudence or merit.
Complaint is the largest tribute heaven receives, and the
sincerest part of our devotion.</p>

<p>The common fluency of speech in many men, and most
women, is owing to a scarcity of matter, and a scarcity of
words: for whoever is a master of language, and hath a
mind full of ideas, will be apt in speaking to hesitate upon
the choice of both; whereas common speakers have only
one set of ideas, and one set of words to clothe them in;
and these are always ready at the mouth: so people come
faster out of church when it is almost empty than when a
crowd is at the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson’s Opinion of his Roughness.</span>—While we were
upon the road, I had the resolution to ask Johnson whether
he thought that the roughness of his manner had been an
advantage or not, and if he would not have done more good
if he had been more gentle. I proceeded to answer myself
thus: “Perhaps it has been of advantage, as it has given
weight to what you said: you could not, perhaps, have
talked with such authority without it.” <i>Johnson</i>: “No,
sir; I have done more good as I am. Obscenity and impiety
have always been repressed in my company.” <i>Boswell</i>:
“True, sir; and that is more than can be said of every
bishop. Greater liberties have been taken in the presence
of a bishop, though a very good man, from his being milder,
and therefore not commanding such awe. Yet, sir, many
people who might have been benefited by your conversation
have been frightened away. A worthy friend of ours
has told me that he has often been afraid to talk to you.”
<i>Johnson</i>: “Sir, he need not have been afraid, if he had anything
rational to say. If he had not, it was better he did
not talk.”—<i>Boswell.</i></p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_COMET_THAT_CAME_BUT" id="THE_COMET_THAT_CAME_BUT">THE COMET THAT CAME BUT
ONCE.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By E. W. MAUNDER, F.R.A.S.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Not quite a year ago the “Threatening Comet,” which
some too-imaginative writers foretold would return in fifteen
years, and occasion the entire destruction of our earth,
by rushing into the sun, and exciting it to a terrible degree
of heat was foretold. How little reason there was to fear
such a catastrophe! We never expected that, so far from
having fifteen years to wait before the truth or error of the
prediction was demonstrated, in less than six months a
glorious stranger would present himself to our gaze, and reveal
that, in one way or another, the dismal prophecy had
been wrong. The message which the wonderful comet, that
was so impressive an object in the morning sky of last October,
had to convey has been interpreted in various senses.
Perhaps the most probable is, that he and his bright predecessors
of 1880 and 1843, which had been supposed to be one
and the same object, were not really so, but only members
of the same family. If so, then the very groundwork of the
theory, on which the return in 1897 was foretold, would be
cut away, and in its place a whole vista of marvellous possibilities
would be opened out to us.</p>

<p>But our present purpose is not to dwell on these, nor to
enlarge on the history, past or future, of any comet which
from time to time has returned, or may return, to our skies,
but to read the lesson conveyed in the marvellous fact that
there are comets which visit us <i>but once</i>.</p>

<p>The devout Kepler, after his last great discovery, sat down
content “to wait a century for a reader.” He had not long
passed away ere the reader was sent, one who read his book
to good purpose indeed. Kepler had been able to discover
three laws to which the planets were obedient, but as to
whether there was any connection between those laws, why
the planets followed them rather than any others which
might have been framed, and what laws the satellites and
comets of the system were subject to, Kepler could not tell.
Newton, on the contrary, discovered the great underlying
principle, of which the laws of Kepler were only some of
the necessary consequences, and showed not merely how
the planets moved, but also to a great extent why they
did so.</p>

<p>Newton had not long established his law of gravitation
before he arrived at a strange discovery. Assuming his theory
to be correct, he worked out by rigid mathematical processes
the shape of the orbits which the planets must follow.
Since we know that they travel in ellipses, we should naturally
have expected that an ellipse would be the resulting
orbit, but instead Newton found he had arrived at an expression
which embraced not one curve but four.</p>

<p>Of these four, one was the oval or ellipse, another the circle,
but the other two were curves of a very different shape
indeed, curves which did not enclose a space, but which had
each two ends, which, however far they were prolonged,
could never meet. And directly this fact was recognized,
an unlooked-for truth was made plain. Comets, which had
hitherto been regarded as perfectly lawless bodies, as irregular
and uncontrolled as the thoughts of an opium-dreamer
seem to be, were now seen to be integral parts of our solar
system. For though so many of them enter our system but
once, never having visited it before, never to visit it again,
yet since these all travel, in obedience to the sun’s attraction,
in one or other of these strange unending curves, curves
which are a necessary consequence of the law of gravitation,
they are manifestly members of the solar family; without
them it would be imperfect, without them the law of gravitation
were but partially illustrated.</p>

<p>Let us follow in imagination the travels of one such comet
through the untold ages of its life. It may have started on
its tremendous voyage whilst the earth was yet a star, or
rather a miniature sun, instinct with fire and light, and all
through the long ages during which the earth was cooling
down and becoming fitted to be the habitation of living
things, the comet slowly but steadily pursued its way. On
the earth one form of life succeeded another, the sea overcame
the land time after time, and time after time the continents
flung off the yoke, and emerged with ampler borders
and fairer scenes. At length the predestined prince came
to his heritage, and Man was made ruler over the perfected
earth—too soon, alas! to forfeit his vice-regal crown by an
act of flagrant rebellion. And still through all these ages,
compared with which the whole lifetime of our race is but a
moment, that distant comet held on its course, never swerving
by a hair’s breadth from the appointed path, obedient to
the law, the self-same law that decrees the fall of the ripened
fruit. But it was still far away, and still it pressed slowly
but steadily forward, whilst kingdoms rose and fell, and
nations multiplied and decayed. But gradually a quicker
energy began to throb within it, and a stronger impulse
drew it forward. The old slow pace could not suffice for its
growing impatience, and it pressed forward with ever-increasing
speed. At length it dashes across the orbit of Neptune;
it has entered the solar system at last. No lingering
now, no slow and halting pace; quicker and quicker it
presses on, and Uranus is past. A shorter interval still,
and glorious Saturn, with his noble rings and numerous satellites,
is left behind, and a few years more and it shoots
across the path of the giant planet Jupiter. The asteroids
and Mars are passed by next, and now, filled with a passionate
desire, it whirls along, brightening as it speeds, and
flaming streamers flying behind it. Moving more quickly
still, it crosses the orbit of the Earth. Venus is reached
next; traversing now in a moment of time space it once
took a year to travel over, it rushes past Mercury. And
now the bright goal is at hand, and quivering through all
its mighty length with the fierce excitement, it speeds forward
at a swifter pace still. And now, glorious with jets
streaming ten thousand miles before it, and tail ten million
leagues behind, it hurls itself into the corona, the region of
that strange pearly glow which in total eclipses is seen to
surround the Sun. And still it hurries forward, but not into
the Sun, its headlong speed is now far too great for even that
mighty attraction to be able to check it in its course, and
draw it in to itself. It ploughs its way perhaps even at the
rate of a million miles an hour, round nearly half of the circumference
of the sun, through the regions where the prominences
play—those rosy flames that rise and rush with such
terrific heat and force from the Sun’s glowing bulk; and its
brief period of splendor is over. Away from the Sun, it falls
back through the corona, across the orbits of Mercury, Venus,
and the Earth, with ever-slackening speed, and fading as it
goes, it recedes toward outer unknown space. Never again
in all eternity will it approach our Sun, never again will it
know the fierce throbbings of that four hours’ sojourn in the
home of the prominences; never, too, will it revisit those
places where it was wandering in the outer darkness when
it first heard the imperious summons which it had thus
obeyed. Slower, ever slower will it travel, out in the fathomless
night, the solar system left far behind. Once and
once only has it entered it, once and once only could it enter.
The Earth, with its attendant Moon, has revolved for
millions of years, enjoying without cease spring, summer,
autumn, and winter. But this strange body, whose winter
was from creation, whose summer lasted but a few short
hours, and whose second winter, so far at all events as it
derives heat and light from our Sun, shall last till heaven
and earth depart like a vesture that is rolled together,
whose movements are so unlike our evenly moving earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
is no mere lawless wanderer—is no intruder on the happy
family of the solar system; it is ruled in its every movement
by the self-same law that guides our earth. Without
it, or bodies like it, gravitation would be but imperfectly
illustrated, and but part of the homage due would be paid
to our Sun.</p>

<p>How great a change has taken place in our views since
the time when men looked upon comets as miracles and
portents, as special acts of creation, obedient to none of the
ordinary laws of nature! And since Newton’s day, changes
as great as that which he effected in astronomy have been
effected in other sciences; and the unity of law, and the
universality of its reign, are acknowledged on every side.
The idea of special acts of creation, or that God interferes
with the regular working of his laws, is discredited, and
creation itself is pushed far back into the unfathomed past.</p>

<p>But this view opens out a most serious question. If God’s
only work was to make the world at the beginning, and give
it wholesome laws, leaving it then to itself, what room is
there for religion and prayer—for faith and hope? And indeed,
arguing in this very manner, there are men of science
who tell us expressly that the only good which prayer can
do is to make the petitioner feel more at ease in his mind;
that Elijah praying for rain was no whit wiser than a Kaffir
or Ashanti conjuror.</p>

<p>But God has <i>not</i> left his world to itself, and every law of nature
is nothing but the expression of his all-pervading, ever-acting
will. How else can the sun, which can not, according
to Newton’s first law, of itself move a single inch, make the
earth spin round it, at the rate of many miles a second? It
explains nothing, it is only to put the fact into other words,
if, when an apple falls, we say “the earth attracted it.” But
“it is the will of God” <i>is</i> an explanation and a sufficient one,
and we may be well assured that unless he expressly ordered
it, not even a toy, released from a baby’s feeble grasp, could
ever move downwards toward the ground. Were he to cease
to will, the universe would cease to be, for in the beginning
it came into existence by his simple word, and from that
time “he upholdeth all things by the word of his power.”
And in these words revelation teaches us what science never
could—behind dead nature to see an ever-living, ever-acting
God.</p>

<p>The mistake men made was this: Some things seemed to
them to be orderly and regular, others disorderly and irregular;
and they foolishly fancied the latter to be therefore
more immediately God’s work than the former, thinking
him “altogether such an one as themselves.” And so, when
further knowledge showed that those things which had
seemed irregular were as fully ordered by law as any of the
others, it appeared as if God’s authority and power were diminished,
since, in their ignorance, men had thought disorder
a proof of his more immediate acting. But “God is
not the author of confusion,” nor is he touched with caprice
or change, for he hath declared “I am the Lord, I change
not.” Perfect law and perfect harmony, are what the Scriptures
teach us to expect in all God’s works, and that every
advance of science shows such perfection far to transcend
all our previous conceptions, should surely not shake our
faith in him and in his word, but strengthen and confirm it.</p>

<p>But yet another difficulty remains. If everything in the
universe is ordered according to law, how is it possible for
miracles, and in a more general sense, answers to prayer, to
take place? Perhaps the comet may help us here. Could
anything seem more miraculous, more to contradict the
general experience of the solar system, with its planets ever
revolving in closed orbits round the sun, than the appearance
of a body which rushed straight toward the sun, took
one half-turn round it, and then receded from it by a different
path, never, never to return? Could anything seem
more like an interference by the Maker with the laws which
he had made? It <i>did</i> seem so until the underlying law was
discovered, and then the seeming discord was perceived to
be really the note needed to complete the perfect harmony.
We at best only stand where Kepler stood, we know only
little fragmentary laws, and we can not affirm that occurrences
which seem as much outside their scope as comets are
outside Kepler’s laws, are not really necessary members of
the greater system of which we have no knowledge as yet.
That miracles are ruled by law may be gathered from many
a passage in the Holy Word. Miracles are “set” in the
Church, as much as apostles and teachers. “This kind goeth
not out but by prayer and fasting;” “he could do no mighty
works there because of their unbelief,” are not obscure hints
of such a law—a spiritual law, it is true, but none the less
a law.</p>

<p>We can watch the progress of science, then, without anxiety
or fear; “rooted and grounded in faith,” believing that
the Lord is King.—<i>London Sunday Magazine.</i></p>

<h2><a name="SCIENCE_AND_COMMON_SENSE" id="SCIENCE_AND_COMMON_SENSE">SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By CHARLES KINGSLEY.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />


<p>The scientific method needs no definition; for it is simply
the exercise of common sense. It is not a peculiar,
unique, professional, or mysterious process of the understanding;
but the same which all men employ, from the
cradle to the grave, in forming correct conclusions.</p>

<p>Every one who knows the philosophic writings of Mr.
John Stuart Mill, will be familiar with this opinion. But
to those who have no leisure to study him, I should recommend
the reading of Professor Huxley’s third lecture on the
origin of species.</p>

<p>In that he shows, with great logical skill, as well as with
some humor, how the man who, on rising in the morning
finds the parlor-window open, the spoons and teapot gone,
the mark of a dirty hand on the window-sill, and that of a
hob-nailed boot outside, and comes to the conclusion that
someone has broken open the window, and stolen the plate,
arrives at that hypothesis—for it is nothing more—by a
long and complex train of inductions and deductions of just
the same kind as those which, according to the Baconian
philosophy, are to be used for investigating the deepest secrets
of Nature.</p>

<p>This is true, even of those sciences which involve long
mathematical calculations. In fact, the stating of the problem
to be solved is the most important element in the calculation;
and that is so thoroughly a labor of common
sense that an utterly uneducated man may, and often does,
state an abstruse problem clearly and correctly; seeing what
ought to be proved, and perhaps how to prove it, though he
may be unable to work the problem out for want of mathematical
knowledge.</p>

<p>But that mathematical knowledge is not—as all Cambridge
men are surely aware—the result of any special gift.
It is merely the development of those conceptions of form
and number which every human being possesses; and any
person of average intellect can make himself a fair mathematician
if he will only pay continuous attention; in plain
English, think enough about the subject.</p>

<p>There are sciences, again, which do not involve mathematical
calculation; for instance, botany, zoölogy, geology,
which are just now passing from their old stage of classificatory
sciences into the rank of organic ones. These are,
without doubt, altogether within the scope of the merest
common sense. Any man or woman of average intellect,
if they will but observe and think for themselves, freely,
boldly, patiently, accurately, may judge for themselves of
the conclusions of these sciences, and may add to these
conclusions fresh and important discoveries.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate my meaning by an example. A man—I
do not say a geologist, but simply a man, ’squire or
ploughman—sees a small valley, say one of the side-glens
which open into the larger valleys in any country. He
wishes to ascertain its age.</p>

<p>He has, at first sight, a very simple measure—that of denudation.
He sees that the glen is now being eaten out by
a little stream, the product of innumerable springs which
arise along its sides, and which are fed entirely by the rain
on the moors above. He finds, on observation, that this
stream brings down some ten cubic yards of sand and
gravel, on an average, every year. The actual quantity of
earth which has been removed to make the glen may be
several million cubic yards. Here is an easy sum in arithmetic.
At the rate of ten cubic yards a year, the stream
has taken several hundred thousand years to make the
glen.</p>

<p>You will observe that this result is obtained by mere
common sense. He has a right to assume that the stream
originally began the glen, because he finds it in the act of
enlarging it; just as much right as he has to assume, if he
find a hole in his pocket, and his last coin in the act of falling
through it, that the rest of his money has fallen through
the same hole. It is a sufficient cause, and the simplest. A
number of observations as to the present rate of denudation,
and a sum which any railroad contractor can do in his head,
to determine the solid contents of the valley, are all that are
needed. The method is that of science: but it is also that
of simple common sense. You will remember, therefore,
that this is no mere theory or hypothesis, but a pretty fair
and simple conclusion from palpable facts; that the probability
lies with the belief that the glen is some hundreds of
thousands of years old; that it is not the observer’s business
to prove it further, but other persons’ to disprove it, if they
can.</p>

<p>But does the matter end here? No. And, for certain
reasons, it is good that it should not end here.</p>

<p>The observer, if he be a cautious man, begins to see if he
can disprove his own conclusions; moreover, being human,
he is probably somewhat awed, if not appalled, by his own
conclusions. Hundreds of thousands of years spent in
making that little glen! Common sense would say that
the longer it took to make, the less wonder there was in its
being made at last: but the instinctive human feeling is
the opposite. There is in men, and there remains in them,
even after they are civilized, and all other forms of the
dread of Nature have died out in them, a dread of size, of
vast space, of vast time; that latter, mind, being always
imagined as space, as we confess when we speak instinctively
of a space of time. They will not understand that
size is merely a relative, not an absolute term; that if we
were a thousand times larger than we are, the universe would
be a thousand times smaller than it is; that if we could
think a thousand times faster than we do, time would be a
thousand times longer than it is; that there is One in whom
we live, and move, and have our being, to whom one day
is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
I believe this dread of size to be merely, like all other superstitions,
a result of bodily fear; a development of the instinct
which makes a little dog run away from a big dog.
Be that as it may, every observer has it; and so the man’s
conclusion seems to him strange, doubtful: he will reconsider
it.</p>

<p>Moreover, if he be an experienced man, he is well aware
that first guesses, first hypotheses, are not always the right
ones: and if he be a modest man, he will consider the fact
that many thousands of thoughtful men in all ages, and
many thousands still, would say, that the glen can only be
a few thousand, possibly a few hundred, years old. And he
will feel bound to consider their opinion; as far as it is, like
his own, drawn from facts, but no further.</p>

<p>So he casts about for all other methods by which the glen
may have been produced, to see if any one of them will account
for it in a shorter time.</p>

<p>1. Was it made by an earthquake? No; for the strata on
both sides are identical, at the same level, and in the same
plane.</p>

<p>2. Or by a mighty current? If so, the flood must have
run in at the upper end before it ran out at the lower. But
nothing has run in at the upper end. All round above are
the undisturbed gravel-beds of the horizontal moor, without
channel or depression.</p>

<p>3. Or by water draining off a vast flat as it was upheaved
out of the sea? That is a likely guess. The valley at its
upper end spreads out like the fingers of a hand, as the gullies
in tide-muds do.</p>

<p>But that hypothesis will not stand. There is no vast unbroken
flat behind the glen. Right and left of it are other
similar glens, parted from it by long narrow ridges: these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
also must be explained on the same hypothesis; but they
can not. For there could not have been surface-drainage
to make them all, or a tenth of them. There are no other
possible hypotheses; and so he must fall back on the original
theory—the rain, the springs, the brook; they have done it
all, even as they are doing it this day.</p>

<p>But is not that still a hasty assumption? May not their
denuding power have been far greater in old times than
now?</p>

<p>Why should it? Because there was more rain then than
now? That he must put out of court; there is no evidence
of it whatsoever.</p>

<p>Because the land was more friable originally? Well,
there is a great deal to be said for that. The experience of
every countryman tells him that bare or fallow land is
more easily washed away than land under vegetation. And
no doubt, when these gravels and sands rose from the sea,
they were barren for hundreds of years. He has some
measure of the time required, but he can tell roughly how
long it takes for sands and shingles left by the sea to become
covered by vegetation. But he must allow that the
friability of the land must have been originally much
greater than now, for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>But again, does that fact really cut off any great space of
time from his hundreds of thousands of years? For when
the land first rose from the sea, that glen was not there.
Some slight bay or bend in the shore determined its site.
That stream was not there. It was split up into a million
little springs, oozing side by side from the shore, and having
each a very minute denuding power, which kept continually
increasing by combination as the glen ate its way
inwards, and the rainfall drained by all these little springs
was collected into the one central stream. So that when
the ground being bare was most liable to be denuded, the
water was least able to do it; and as the denuding power of
the water increased, the land, being covered with vegetation,
became more and more able to resist it.</p>

<p>So the two disturbing elements in the calculation may be
fairly set off against each other, as making a difference of
only a few thousands or tens of thousands of years either
way; and the age of the glen may fairly be, if not a million
years, yet such a length of years as mankind still speak of
with bated breath, as if forsooth it would do them some
harm.</p>

<p>I trust that every scientific man will agree with me, that
the imaginary ’squire or ploughman would have been conducting
his investigation strictly according to the laws of
the Baconian philosophy. You will remark, meanwhile,
that he has not used a single scientific term, or referred to a
single scientific investigation; and has observed nothing
and thought nothing, which might not have been observed
and thought by any one who chose to use his common
sense, and not to be afraid.</p>

<p>But because he has come round, after all this further investigation,
to something very like his first conclusion, was
all that further investigation useless? No—a thousand
times, no. It is this very verification of hypotheses which
makes the sound ones safe, and destroys the unsound. It
is this struggle with all sorts of superstitions which makes
science strong and sure, and her march irresistible, winning
ground slowly, but never receding from it. It is this buffeting
of adversity which compels her not to rest dangerously
upon the shallow sand of first guesses, and single observations;
but to strike her roots down, deep, wide, and
interlaced, into the solid ground of actual facts.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to insist on this point. For there
have been men in all past ages—I do not say whether there
are any such now, but I am inclined to think there will be
hereafter,—men who have tried to represent scientific
method as something difficult, mysterious, peculiar, unique,
not to be attained by the unscientific mass; and this not for
the purpose of exalting science, but rather of discrediting
her. For as long as the masses, educated or uneducated,
are ignorant of what scientific method is, they will look on
scientific men, as the middle age looked on necromancers,
as a privileged, but awful and uncanny caste, possessed of
mighty secrets; who may do them great good, but also may
do them great harm. Which belief on the part of the
masses will enable these persons to install themselves as
the critics of science, though not scientific men themselves:
and—as Shakspere has it—to talk of Robin Hood,
though they never shot in his bow. Thus they become
mediators to the masses between the scientific and
the unscientific worlds. They tell them, You are not to
trust the conclusions of men of science at first hand. You
are not fit judges of their facts or of their methods. It is
we who will, by a cautious electicism, choose out for you
such of their conclusions as are safe for you; and them we
will advise you to believe. To the scientific man, on the
other hand, as often as anything is discovered unpleasing
to them, they will say, imperiously and <i>ex cathedrâ</i>, Your
new theory contradicts the established facts of science.
For they will know well that whatever the men of science
think of their assertion, the masses will believe it; totally
unaware that the speakers are by their very terms showing
their ignorance of science; and that what they call established
facts scientific men call merely provisional conclusions,
which they would throw away to-morrow without a
pang were the known facts explained better by a fresh
theory, or did fresh facts require one.</p>

<p>This has happened too often. It is in the interest of superstition
that it should happen again; and the best way
to prevent it surely is to tell the masses, Scientific method
is no peculiar mystery, requiring a peculiar initiation. It
is simply common sense, combined with uncommon courage,
which includes uncommon honesty and uncommon
patience; and if you will be brave, honest, patient, rational,
you will need no mystagogues to tell you what in science to
believe and what not to believe; for you will be just as
good judges of scientific facts and theories as those who assume
the right of guiding your convictions. You are men
and women: and more than that you need not be.</p>

<h2><a name="ANECDOTES_OF_FASHION" id="ANECDOTES_OF_FASHION">ANECDOTES OF FASHION.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By I. D’ISRAELI.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />


<p>The origin of many fashions was in the endeavor to conceal
some deformity of the inventor; hence the cushions,
ruffs, hoops, and other monstrous devices. If a reigning
beauty chanced to have an unequal hip, those who had
very handsome hips would load them with that false rump
which the other was compelled by the unkindness of nature
to substitute. Patches were invented in England in the
reign of Edward VI by a foreign lady, who in this manner
ingeniously covered a wen on her neck. Full-bottomed
wigs were invented by a French barber, one Duviller, whose
name they perpetuated, for the purpose of concealing an elevation
in the shoulder of the Dauphin. Charles VII of
France introduced long coats to hide his ill-made legs.
Shoes with very long points, full two feet in length, were
invented by Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Anjou, to conceal
a large excrescence on one of his feet. When Francis I was
obliged to wear his hair short, owing to a wound he received
in the head, it became a prevailing fashion at court. Others,
on the contrary, adapted fashions to set off their peculiar
beauties; as Isabella of Bavaria, remarkable for her gallantry,
and the fairness of her complexion, introduced the
fashion of leaving the shoulders and part of the neck uncovered.</p>

<p>Fashions have frequently originated from circumstances as
silly as the following one. Isabella, daughter of Philip II,
and wife of the Archduke Albert, vowed not to change her
linen till Ostend was taken; this siege, unluckily for her
comfort, lasted three years; and the supposed color of the
archduchess’s linen gave rise to a fashionable color, hence
called <i>l’Isabeau</i>, or the Isabella; a kind of whitish-yellow-dingy.
Sometimes they originate in some temporary event:
as after the battle of Steenkirk, where the allies wore large
cravats, by which the French frequently seized hold of them,
a circumstance perpetuated on the medals of Louis XIV,
cravats were called Steenkirks; and after the battle of Ramillies,
wigs received that denomination.</p>

<p>The hair has in all ages been an endless topic for the declamation
of the moralist, and the favorite object of fashion.
If the <i>beau monde</i> wore their hair luxuriant, or their wig
enormous, the preachers, as in Charles the Second’s reign,
instantly were seen in the pulpit with their hair cut shorter,
and their sermon longer, in consequence; respect was,
however, paid by the world to the size of the <i>wig</i>, in spite of
the <i>hair-cutter</i> in the pulpit. Our judges, and until lately
our physicians, well knew its magical effect. In the reign
of Charles II the hair-dress of the ladies was very elaborate;
it was not only curled and frizzled with the nicest art, but
set off with certain artificial curls, then too emphatically
known by the pathetic terms of <i>heart-breakers</i> and <i>love-locks</i>.
So late as William and Mary, lads, and even children,
wore wigs; and if they had not wigs, they curled their hair
to resemble this fashionable ornament. Women then were
the hair-dressers.</p>

<p>The courts in all ages and in every country are the modelers
of fashions, so that all the ridicule, of which these are so
susceptible, must fall on them, and not upon their servile
imitators the citizens. This complaint is made even so far
back as in 1586, by Jean des Caures, an old French moralist,
who, in declaiming against the fashions of his day, notices
one, of the ladies carrying mirrors fixed to their waists,
which seemed to employ their eyes in perpetual activity.
From this mode will result, according to honest Des Caures,
their eternal damnation. “Alas!” he exclaims, “in what
age do we live: to see such depravity which we see, that induces
them even to bring into church these scandalous
mirrors hanging about their waists! Let all histories divine,
human, and profane be consulted; never will it be
found that these objects of vanity were ever thus brought
into public by the most meretricious of the sex. It is true,
at present none but the ladies of the court venture to wear
them; but long it will not be before every citizen’s daughter,
and every female servant, will wear them!” Such in
all times has been the rise and decline of fashion; and the
absurd mimicry of the citizens, even of the lowest classes,
to their very ruin, in straining to rival the newest fashion,
has mortified and galled the courtier.</p>

<h2><a name="LANGUAGE_IN_ANIMALS" id="LANGUAGE_IN_ANIMALS">LANGUAGE IN ANIMALS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By RICHARD BUDD PAINTER.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>No one who has clearly observed animals, birds, bees, and
other creatures, can possibly deny their possession of a faculty
of communicating ideas to one another.</p>

<p>Admitting this fully, my object therefore will be, while
elicitating some of the facts concerning animal language, to
maintain the consistency of my argument in regard to man,
as contrasted with animals, by showing that such animal
language is not of an intellectual kind, but only such as is
necessary for the conduct, and use, of the highest phases of
the animal “instinctive mind,” according to its ordained
capacity in each species.</p>

<p>In my opinion, every kind of animal possesses a different
sort of language; and which is peculiar to its genus; just as
in the case of different races of man, a language which
though capable of interpretation by a member of the group
which speaks it, can not be generally understood by other
races in minute detail; although among both men and animals
there are a few cries, etc., that can be generally understood;
as those of alarm communicated by screams, stamping
of the ground, etc. But we must note that whatever
may be the kind and extent of language in animals, it is in
them always <i>expressive only of animal sensations and sense
impressions and reasonings</i>.</p>

<p>Particular animals, birds, insects, etc., bark, gibber, bray,
sing, crow, grunt, rub their wing-cases (crickets), etc.,
showing that each has a different language, and different
modes of expressing emotion: showing, too, by these differences
that their sorts of minds must vary much more
from one another, than do the minds of men in their different
human varieties; for men do not employ such immensely
different modes of conveying their ideas and feelings
by sounds as is the case in animals with their lowing,
snorting, barking, etc.</p>

<p>The making of these very different sounds by different
animals is therefore to me the clearest possible proof that
different animals possess different sorts of mind; yet of
course there is some general resemblance, as is the case in
so many of God’s works made diversely in specific instances,
yet on the same general plan in the main. I said
just now that, while fully admitting the possession of a
kind of language by animals, I should maintain strictly
that it is not of an intellectual character, and I may be
asked what I mean by this assertion.</p>

<p>My answer is that I believe the language of the animal is
limited chiefly to the expression of animal needs; and animal
sensations; and the conveyance of such requirements,
and feelings to their kind; although it can doubtless be used
also for communicating in some slight degree such ideas
concerning animal experiences and feelings as their feeble
reasoning powers enable them to arrive at; such as the devices
for protection, and escape from danger; and the manifestation
and interpretation of the sort of questionings, and
answerings which occur when two dogs meet, as shown by
the wagging of tails, and pleased looks, or the reverse; and
which seem to indicate as if the dogs could by gesture, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
ask, and reply to one another, whether it is to be peace, or
war.</p>

<p>My belief is that the mind of the mere animal is in no
ease able to reach beyond the limit of simple ministration
to the animal needs, and animal feelings, and instincts of
the creature according to its kind; and that it can never
form pure intellectual ideas, such as those of intellectual
love; intellectual hatred; intellectual ideas as to time;
space; God, etc. Nor can it form the mental abstractions—words—and
by the use of these arrive at the intellectual
operation of mind which their employment renders possible.</p>


<h4>MODES OF EXPRESSING LANGUAGE IN ANIMALS.</h4>

<p>These may take place—</p>

<p>First—By <i>vocal intonations</i> (as in man) in brutes and
birds: and I may remark that all brutes possess a tongue,
larynx, and vocal cords; and that birds have these also,
with the exception that the bird’s larynx (syrinx) is rather
modified from that of man and the mammalia; still we
know its perfection; and we know how the parrot can
use it.</p>

<p>Secondly—<i>By gesture</i> and visual regard, as seen in dogs,
and in birds.</p>

<p>Thirdly—<i>By means of sounds other than vocal</i>, as is witnessed
in the stamping on the ground by various animals
to intimate danger. Also the noises of insects made by
rubbing their wing-cases (elytra) together, as in the cricket,
etc.</p>

<p>Fourthly—<i>By means of touch</i>, as in the cases of ants, bees,
and other insects, which can convey meanings by crossing
their antennæ.</p>

<p>Fifthly—Other signs, etc., perhaps, with which we have
no acquaintance, and can form no conjecture.</p>

<p>Sixthly—Information can also probably be ascertained by
smell.</p>

<p>By any one of these means separately, or together, it
doubtless is possible for very numerous species of creatures
to communicate with their kind by means of a language,—little
articulate it may be—but still more or less articulate,
according to endowment.</p>

<p>Let us now consider animal language by whatever mode
effected; and to do so I propose to divide the subject into
two sections.</p>

<p>First—<i>The language of the sensations.</i></p>

<p>Second—<i>The language of the instinctive mind.</i></p>

<p>First—<i>The language expressive of the bodily sensations.</i></p>

<p>This, I have no doubt, is in great measure, if not entirely,
automatic, for like as when you tread on a man’s toe, or
give him a thump on the back, he involuntarily cries out—Oh!
So when you tread on a cat’s tail, she gives utterance
to her characteristic scream.</p>

<p>But it is not only bodily pain that can be proclaimed
aloud, but hosts of other sensations can also be expressed in
various ways. The lamb, or the kitten, feels the sensation
of hunger, and it doubtless involuntarily bleats, or mews,
for its mother; although it does not in the least know the
meaning of “Ba,” or “Mew,” or why it gives utterance to
such sounds.</p>

<p>And so of the notes of the crowing cock, the “gobbling”
turkey, and the sibilant cricket, etc.</p>

<p>And then as to numbers of other cries, etc., too numerous
to mention; such as the chirping of sparrows on the approach
of rain, the moaning and whining of animals in
pain, the cackling of the hen after laying an egg, etc.,—all
these arise doubtless from bodily sensations, and may be
termed the language of the involuntary or automatic part
of the organic mind.</p>

<p>Second—<i>The language of the instinctive mind.</i></p>

<p>I have above briefly spoken of the language expressive of
the bodily sensations, and have termed it really the automatic
language of what I call the “organic mind,” or “vital
force.” Now we must speak of the language capable of
being used by the “instinctive mind”—a language, I believe,
that is sometimes involuntary or automatic, but which
at other times is under the voluntary control of such kind
of will, judgment, and choice as is capable of being exercised
by the creature according to its mental endowment as
decreed and specialized.</p>

<p>Thus, by sounds or gestures, or other modes, animals,
birds, insects, etc., can express fear of danger, friendliness,
hatred, anger, triumph, etc.; and in some instances, as in
the bee, can communicate such special information as that
the “queen is dead,” etc.</p>

<p>See two dogs meet: they evidently quite understand each
other, and by wagging of tails and bright glances, or the reverse;
and a cheerful bark or a savage snarl, can quickly
intimate whether a gambol or a fight is to result. No
doubt, as in man, this result will be greatly guided by the
state of the bodily sensations (digestion, etc.), and as to age
and natural character; but yet the dogs’ communications,
we may be sure are only concerning pure animal sensations
or concerns, and never assume an intellectual character,
such as, “How is your beloved mistress?” etc.</p>

<p>Then look at the watchful bird on the tree-top, or the sentinel
bull on the hillock; each can sound the alarm, because
its intuition or its experience tells of danger. And then
look at a party of rooks holding a palaver; who can doubt
but that in some way they communicate certain feelings
and perhaps ideas? And so as to hosts of other birds and
beasts; but then their mental processes cannot possibly—for
reasons which I have repeatedly given—be considered as
of an intellectual sort like that of man, indeed it very probably
may be of so different a kind to ours that we can not
even guess at the nature of it.</p>

<p>I have not space to illustrate all the visible manifestations
of the different phases of mind in animals, but to mention
only one other, who can doubt but that in regard to triumph
after a victory, the cock when he gets on an elevation and
crows must experience some of the pride of conquest, and
must have a sort of conception of the abstract idea of exultation
in regard to his courage and prowess?</p>

<p>And yet although, as in my opinion, we must not delude
ourselves by thinking that the foregoing are simply produced
by reflex actions arising only from bodily sensations;
so we must not equally be misled by supposing that such
results arise from intellectual reasoning. No! in my opinion,
although all these acts and sounds are performed, and
produced, in some measure—<i>and in some measure only</i>—according
to the dictates of a <i>sort of conscious will; and a sort

<h2><a name="THE_ELECTRIC_LIGHT" id="THE_ELECTRIC_LIGHT">THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By A. A. CAMPBELL SWINTON.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>It seems at present that electricity is to be the illuminating
agent of the future, and that, as gas has now all but superseded
candles and oil, so in turn gas will soon be superseded
by electricity. The reasons for this change are several
and various, and follow that most immutable of natural
laws, the law of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>About the commencement of the present century, Sir
Humphry Davy, the eminent chemist, succeeded in producing
at the Royal Institution the most brilliant light then
known. By passing the electricity derived from an enormous
battery of four thousand plates through two charcoal
points separated from one another, he obtained in air
a continuous electric discharge four inches in length, which
was increased to seven inches when the experiment was repeated
<i>in vacuo</i>.</p>

<p>This discharge, or arc, as it is called, consisted of very
minute particles of charcoal, which being raised to white
heat by the resistance offered by the points to the electric
current, were also by its means conveyed with great rapidity
from one charcoal point to the other, emitting during their
passage a light of dazzling brilliancy. The discharge of
heated particles being continuous, the arc could be maintained
for a considerable length of time.</p>

<p>This light, however, was entirely impracticable for any
but purely experimental purposes. A battery of four thousand
plates is not easily maintained in working order, and
besides, the expense of such an arrangement puts it entirely
out of the question. Of late years, however, a new method
of producing electricity on a large scale has been discovered
in the dynamo-electric machine, by means of which currents
of great volume and intensity can be obtained from
the power generated by a steam engine, water wheel, or
other prime motor.</p>

<p>This great discovery instigated scientific men to try and
bring the electric light within the range of practical utility,
in which end they have already been eminently successful.</p>

<p>It was found that as the charcoal points in Davy’s lamp
in process of time became oxidized and burnt away, it was
necessary to have some arrangement by which they should
be maintained at a constant distance from one another.
This problem was first solved by Duboscq, a French <i>savant</i>,
who by the combined action of the electric current and a
system of clockwork, succeeded in obtaining a constant and
steady light. Gas carbon, as found incrusted on the inside
of gas retorts, was at the same time substituted for the charcoal
employed by Davy, as it was found to burn more
equally and to last much longer.</p>

<p>In July, 1877, a new form of electric light apparatus was
introduced into France and elsewhere, which, from its practical
simplicity, attracted a large amount of attention. This
invention is due to Mr. Jablochkoff, a Russian engineer, and
is known as the Jablochkoff candle. In this form of regulator
all clockwork and mechanism are avoided; the two
carbons are placed side by side, in parallel lines, and are
separated by some substance which, though readily fusible,
at the same time offers so enormous a resistance to the passage
of the electric current as practically to prevent its passage
through it at all. Kaolin clay and plaster of Paris have
both been employed for this purpose with success. The current
not being able to pass through the insulating material,
can only pass between the two carbons at the extremity of
the candle, where the arc is therefore formed. As the carbons
burn away, the insulating material melts, and an uninterrupted
light is obtained. As it is found that one carbon
burns away more quickly than the other, in this form of
lamp the electric current is supplied alternately in different
directions, which makes the carbons burn equally, the reversions
of the electricity being so rapid that the arc is to all
appearances continuous. This lamp has been largely employed
in Paris, and is at present in actual operation on the
Thames embankment. Its chief defects are its great expense
and the unsteady character of the light, which, owing to the
oxidation of the insulating material, flickers and changes
color. Another lamp, and one which has been largely used
in Europe and in America, is the Brush regulator, called
after its inventor. In this form the carbons are vertically
one above the other, the upper one being controlled by an
electro magnet, which supports it, allowing it to descend of
its own weight when, through the distance between the carbons
becoming too great, the current is weakened, and the
magnet unable to support its load, thus keeping the arc
of a constant length. There are a large number of other arc
regulators, some of which work very well, and are largely
employed; but they are most of them based on a very similar
principle to that of the Brush lamp, and therefore they
need no special description.</p>

<p>It has been found, however, that, adapted as some of the
arc regulators are for the illumination of streets and large
areas, none of them are at all able to compete with gas in
the lighting of private houses. Not only do they require
the constant attention of skilled workmen to renew the carbons
and to clean the mechanism, but they give far too
strong and dazzling a light for any but very large apartments.</p>

<p>For domestic lighting we therefore come to quite a new
departure in electric lamps; instead of the arc we have the
incandescent regulator.</p>

<p>If an intense electric current be transmitted through a fine
platinum wire, the latter will, in a very few seconds, become
white hot, and give a considerable amount of light. If
such a platinum wire be enclosed in a glass globe, from which
the air has been extracted, we have one kind of incandescent
lamp, so called because the light is produced through
the incandescence or intense heating of a platinum or other
conductor. It was a lamp such as this that, when brought
out by Mr. Edison two years ago, produced such a scare
among holders of gas shares. It was not, however, a practical
invention; it was found that the electric current constantly
melted the platinum, or broke the glass envelope,
after which the lamp was of course entirely useless. In vain
Mr. Edison tried various alloys of platinum and iridium;
nothing of that nature was found that could resist the intense
heat produced by the electricity. While, however,
the incandescent lamp was not progressing very rapidly in
America, in England Mr. Swan, of Newcastle, who had
been experimenting with the electric light for some time,
brought out another kind of regulator, which has given rise
to great expectations. The Swan lamp consists of a pear-shaped
globe, blown out of glass, and from which all the air,
or at least as much as can be, has been exhausted. In this
globe there is a tiny carbon filament, manufactured of carbonized
thread, in the form of a loop, which is attached to
two platinum wires which project through the glass bulb.
On an electric current being passed through the carbon, by
means of wires attached to the platinum projections, a soft
yet brilliant light is obtained. These lamps, which give a
light corresponding in power and color to an ordinary gas
flame, can now be obtained for five shillings each, and it is
probable that this price may yet be still further reduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison also, having abandoned his earlier platino-iridium
regulator, has brought out another lamp very similar
to Mr. Swan’s. In his case the carbon filament is formed of
carbonized bamboo, and the glass bulb is of an elongated
form. Incandescent lamps have also been invented by
Maxim, Crooks, Fox Lane, and others; but they only differ
in details of manufacture from those of Swan and Edison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Among edifices now entirely illuminated by the Swan
system may be mentioned twenty-one steam vessels, including
several war ships—the <i>City of Rome</i>, an Anchor
Liner, which is second only to the <i>Great Eastern</i> in point
of size, and several passenger boats in the Cunard and
White Star Lines.</p>

<p>One of the greatest objections to gas as an indoor illuminant
is the fact that not only does it burn a large amount of
the oxygen of the air, but it also gives off during combustion
carbonic acid gas and other poisonous vapors, besides
a great amount of heat, thus vitiating the atmosphere. In
public buildings where there is much gas burnt and little
ventilation, this is seen to advantage, the air becoming in a
short space of time hot and unwholesome. Now in the case
of the incandescent electric light, this is altogether altered,
the incandescent filament which produces the light, although
in itself enormously hot, is too small in point of size
to radiate much heat, and the fact of its being hermetically
enclosed in a glass globe, which is impervious to the atmosphere,
entirely prevents the escape of any noxious gases.
The same circumstance prevents there being any consumption
of oxygen.</p>

<p>These facts make the electric light far more wholesome
than gas for the illumination of music-halls, churches, or
other places of concourse. In a recent trial in the Town
Hall at Birmingham, the employment of gas raised the
temperature of the atmosphere thirty-eight degrees in three
hours, while the building was equally well lighted with
electricity for seven hours with a rise in temperature of
only two degrees. Thus, after a period of lighting by electricity
2.33 times as long as by gas, the temperature at the
ceiling was increased by only 1-19th of the amount due to
gas.</p>

<p>Another great advantage consequent to the employment
of incandescent lighting, is the greater immunity from accidental
fire; for as the carbon filament is instantly entirely
consumed, the moment the glass envelope is broken it is
impossible for the lamp to ignite anything in its vicinity
however inflammable. The experiment has been tried of
breaking a lighted incandescent lamp in a vessel containing
gunpowder, with perfect safety. As these lamps may
be placed in any position, they lend themselves very readily
to ornamental and decorative purposes. At the recent electrical
exhibition at the Crystal Palace a very beautiful
chandelier of Edison lamps was shown, in which the lamps,
which were of very small size, formed the petals of finely
worked glass and brass flowers. This chandelier had a really
magnificent effect when lighted.</p>

<p>These and other facts too numerous to mention, demonstrate
that electricity, when properly applied, will be a far
more elegant, safe, and wholesome agent for illuminating
purposes, than coal-gas as now employed. But in order to
have the full benefits of its use, a system is required by
which the electric current shall be produced and conveyed
to the lamps.</p>

<p>Not only has Mr. Edison invented an incandescent lamp,
but he has also identified his name with a very complete
system for producing the light on a large scale to suit both
domestic and commercial requirements. In the first place
he has invented a peculiar form of dynamo-machine, which
when driven at great speed by powerful steam or water engines,
produces the electricity in great quantity at some
central station. From this centre the current is conveyed
by copper wires laid under the streets or over the roofs of
the houses, these conductors being tapped of their electric
fluid by smaller wires which convey the electricity into the
houses, in a way similar to that in which gas is conveyed
by small pipes from the larger street mains. In each house
is an electric meter, a special invention of Mr. Edison’s,
which measures the quantity of electricity which passes
through it. This meter is very ingenious, and therefore the
principle on which it is based may be described. If a current
of electricity be passed through a solution of sulphate
of copper, contained in a copper jar, the sulphate solution is
decomposed and metallic copper is deposited on the inside
of the jar. Now it has been proved by experiment, that the
amount of copper deposited is always directly proportional
to the strength and duration of the electric current. Mr.
Edison’s meter consists of such an arrangement, and he
finds that by weighing the copper jar, so as to determine
exactly what it has gained in weight through the metallic
deposition of the solution it contains, he can accurately
calculate in units the amount of electricity that has passed
through the meter. By means of this beautiful discovery
electricity can be supplied and paid for in a manner very
similar to that employed in the case of gas at the present
time.</p>

<p>Within the building to be illuminated, the electric fluid
reaches the lamps along small copper wires, about the thickness
of ordinary bell wire, which are covered with a coating
of gutta percha to prevent the escape of the electricity,
which might cause sparks or even fire, or in any case seriously
injure any one who might come in contact with the
bare metal, by giving him a very violent if not fatal electric
shock. The lamps themselves may be fixed to ordinary gas
brackets. Mr. Edison has designed some special ones, and
the light can be turned on and off, by means of a tap or button,
with as great or even still greater facility than gas.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison has recently established a central station in
New York, from which he proposes to light the houses included
in an area of a wide radius from the center. In part
of this area the installation of the lamps and wires is now
complete, and the light is giving every satisfaction, the cost
being considerably below that of gas, which in the United
States is very expensive. It must be remembered that electric
lighting is comparatively a new science, and not yet
fully understood. There is very little doubt that, by practice,
it will before long approach more nearly to perfection,
and sooner or later entirely supersede gas, the arc form of
lamp being employed for the illumination of streets and
large areas, while the incandescent pattern meets domestic
requirements.—<i>Good Words.</i></p>

<p>New Mexico is Spain in the United States—a region
where the Spanish language, customs, and habits prevail,
where the debates of the legislature and the pleadings of
the courts are in a foreign tongue; a territory where an
American feels as one in a foreign country, and is a stranger
in his own land.</p>

<p>While the latest section to receive American civilization,
it was the first to be occupied by Europeans. When our
pilgrim fathers were shivering through their first New
England winter, New Mexico had been settled half a century.
When they were making</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>the Spanish cavalier was chanting the “Te Deum” in
churches even then beginning to be venerable with age.
And there to-day are the descendants of those brave old
Castilians whose prowess made illustrious the reign of
Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>

<p>In 1677 a book was published in London giving an account
“of America and all the principal kingdoms, provinces,
seas, and islands of it.” Mr. Heylin, the author,
thus speaks of New Mexico in volume IV: “Nova Mexicana
is bounded on the south with New Biscay; on the
west with Quivara; the countreyes, on the north and east,
not discovered hitherto, though some extend eastward as
far as Florida, extended two hundred and fifty leagues from
the town and mines of Santa Barbara, and how much beyond
that none can tell; the relations of this country being
so uncertain and incredulous that I dare say nothing positively
of the soil or people, but much less of the towns and
cities which are said to be in it.”</p>

<p>New Mexico, as at present constituted, has an area of
121,201 square miles, and in a general way may be said to
consist of tablelands, mountains, and valleys. The tablelands
rise one above another in well-defined terraces, with
an altitude above sea level of from 5,000 feet in the southeast,
to 7,500 feet in the northwest. These tablelands cover
about two-thirds of the Territory, and constitute the valuable
grazing lands. The mountainous region consists of the
Rocky Mountains, which enter the Territory from the
north in two chains—like the prongs of a fork. The eastern
chain terminates a few miles south of Sante Fe, while
the western one ends in the broken and detached ranges of
the southern section of the Territory. These mountains are
rich in gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, and coal. Sections
of them are covered with valuable timber, and among them
are many medicinal springs. The valleys lie between these
mountain ranges, and contain the agricultural lands, and
are farmed by artificial irrigation. These valleys produce
good crops of corn, wheat, beans, etc., and in the southern
half of the Territory raise fine apples, pears, plums, apricots,
peaches, and grapes, the grapes up to the present
time being more abundant than other fruits. In addition
to the above, the Messilla (Ma-see´-ya) valley produces
quinces, figs, and pomegranates. Artificial irrigation is
supplied from the melting snows of the mountains. The
principal streams are the Rio Grande (Ree´-o Gran-da), the
Canadian, the Pecos (Pa-cos), the San Juan (San Whan),
and the Gila (Hee-la).</p>

<p>The Rio Grande River is the Nile of America. It is 1,800
miles long and of almost equal volume from its source to its
mouth, flowing hundreds of miles without receiving a tributary
of any size, being fed almost entirely from the snows
of the mountains. Along on either side of the river are
canals conveying the water to the adjacent farms. The
water is exceedingly roily and its annual deposit of sediment
upon the land increases its fertility.</p>

<p>The climate is unexcelled by any portion of the United
States—being a succession of bright sunshiny days almost
the year through. The country is free from malarial, billious
and lung troubles, general debility and asthma.</p>

<p>New Mexico has much of antiquarian interest. The mysteries
connected with its earlier history and the evidences
of former greatness throw a halo of romance around it.
The country when first visited in 1536, or ’37, by Spaniards
was filled with the ruins of great cities, which ruins are
still in existence. In some places, acres of ground are still
covered with pieces of broken pottery. The mountains, in
sections, are honeycombed with abandoned dwellings, like
Petra of old, or with the remains of ancient mining operations,
from which were drawn those vast supplies of gold
and silver found at Montezuma’s court.</p>

<p>In the Cañon de Chilly (de-shay) high up in the face of
perpendicular walls of rock are hundreds of ruins now tenantless
and desolate. Among some of these ruins which
we have visited are sepulchres, about four feet square, of
mortar-laid stone, in which we found human skeletons.</p>

<p>In the Cañon de Chaco are great buildings with three and
four stories of walls still standing, built in the most substantial
manner of cut stone and neatly plastered on the inside.
The country in the immediate vicinity of these ruins
is wild and desolate, and no clew to the builders has yet
been found. We only know that years, possibly ages ago,
great cities grew, flourished and passed away, leaving extensive
ruins as the evidence of their existence.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixteenth century the Spaniards took
possession of the country, subjugated the native races and
made them slaves to work the newly-opened mines. The
Spanish rule was so cruel that in 1680 the Pueblos rebelled
and drove them from the country. Then commenced a war,
lasting many years, making the valley of the Rio Grande
classic ground, as the Spanish forces again and again advanced
up the valley, only to be driven back by the Pueblos,
until, through treachery and dissensions among the
native forces, the Spanish were again in full control.</p>

<p>New Mexico became known to Americans first through
the explorations of Captains Long, Nicollet, and Fremont.
La Londe, a Frenchman, was sent by Morrison, of Kaskaskia,
Illinois, on a trading trip in 1804. He was followed by
James Pursley in 1805. Pike visited there in 1807, and a
train of goods was sent in 1812 by Knight, Beard, Chambers,
and eight others. This party were seized by the authorities
and held as prisoners for nine years. Caravans of traders
were furnished with a government escort in 1829, 1834, and
1843.</p>

<p>In 1848 New Mexico was annexed to the United States.</p>

<p>The majority of the people reside in villages. These are
largely of the same pattern, and consist of a large public
square, around which are grouped without much attention
to regular streets, a number of one-story adobe (sun-dried)
brick houses. The individual houses are built around the
four sides of smaller squares called <i>placitas</i>. The rooms of the
house open on this <i>placita</i>; also the stable. The buildings
are usually one story high, with dirt floors and flat dirt roofs.
During the rainy season the roofs leak badly. Among the
older houses there are but few that have glass windows. A
few others have mica windows. The larger number have
an open lattice work, protected in stormy weather by a
tight board shutter. The roof is made of poles, covered first
with grass, then two feet of dirt, and is used for various family
purposes. (2 Kings 19: 26; Acts 10: 9.) The floor is the native
earth, beaten hard, then covered with a layer of adobe
clay. The fire-place is in a corner, and on three sides of the
room a raised bench of clay forms a seat, and also a shelf
for piling away the bed blankets during the day. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the houses, especially of the poorer classes, are without
chair, bedstead, or table. Many of the rooms are neatly
whitewashed with a white clay found in that region, and
the walls hung with crucifixes, mirrors, and lithograph pictures
of saints. There is one large opening, or gate, into the
<i>placita</i>, admitting alike the family, donkeys, goats and
sheep. The streets are narrow, irregular, and without sidewalks.
The roads, worn by the travel of centuries, are
lower than the adjacent country, and during a rainy season
filled with muddy water. Wagons are scarce, as also are
the native carts, some of them with a primitive wheel, constructed
from a solid section of a tree.</p>

<p>The Mexican’s chief friend is the donkey, and in the
streets of the villages are to be seen droves of them loaded
with hay, fire-wood, vegetables, crates of fruit, melons, merchandise,
casks of whisky, trunks, lumber, etc. It is no uncommon
thing to see a drove, each with a heavy stick of
timber projecting into the air beyond his head, and the
other end dragging on the ground behind him.</p>

<p>In the fields are occasional lodges (Isaiah 1: 8) as a shelter
while watching the vineyard, melon or grain fields.</p>

<p>Roads for foot-passengers and pack-animals run through
the grain and corn fields (Mark 2: 23; Matthew 13: 4) and
along the unfenced wayside were the graves of the former
inhabitants, or the points where the pall-bearers rested in
bearing the body to the grave, marked with a rude board
cross and pile of stones (Joshua 7: 26; 2 Samuel 18: 17). The
women carry water in great jars on their heads or shoulders
(Gen. 24: 46).</p>

<p>They plow like the ancients with a crooked stick fastened
to the horns of the oxen—several yoke of oxen following
one another (1 Kings 19: 19).</p>

<p>As in the days of Ruth and Boaz, men and women still
reap with a sickle and the poor get the gleanings (Ruth 2:
15-23). The grain when reaped is spread out on threshing
floors made smooth by packing the earth (Gen. 50: 10; 1
Sam. 23: 1) where it is threshed out by driving around in a
circle sheep, horses or oxen (Deut. 25: 4). After cleaning out
the bulk of the straw with forks, the wheat and chaff are
shoveled into blankets, which by a series of jerks, similar to
shaking carpets, toss their contents into the air, the chaff
blowing one side and the wheat falling back in the blanket.
This process can only be carried on when the wind is favorable;
consequently to improve a favorable wind they work
all night (Ruth 3: 2). Another process is to lift the wheat
and chaff in a bucket as high as the head and empty it
slowly upon a blanket spread on the ground. Separated
from the chaff, the wheat is taken to a neighboring stream
and washed in large earthen jars, after which it is spread
upon woolen blankets to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>The principal diet of the people is <i>chile colorado</i> (col-o-row).
There are several varieties of this fiery dish; one
made of beef is called <i>carne</i>. A more common dish is made
of mutton and called <i>carnero</i>. The flesh is boiled to a pulp,
to which is added <i>chile</i>. <i>Chile</i> is prepared by rolling red
pepper on a stone until pods and seeds are a soft mass. It
tastes as red-hot iron is supposed to taste. It is said that a
new beginner on this diet ought to have a copper-lined
throat.</p>

<p>Many old churches are still in use. They are built of
adobe brick, with dirt roof and dirt floor. Some of them
possess paintings evidently imported from Spain. There
are also many ruder home-made paintings on the walls.
They are without seats or pews, the worshippers kneeling or
sitting on the floor. They are also generally much out of
repair. They contain many images, and in some of the
churches a bier with a life-size image of the Savior. At certain
festivals this is carried in a procession, and on Good
Friday is used to dramatize the crucifixion of Christ. In
some of the churches are exhibitions of Scriptural scenes
covering the life of the Savior, apostles and early martyrs.
Occasionally an image of Christ is rigged with a movable
arm, which is turned by a crank. As with the movement
of the crank the hand comes up, it is supposed to throw
blessings upon the waiting congregation below. Upon one
occasion during a long dry spell, they carried an image of
the Virgin Mary in stately processions through the fields to
secure rain. But the drouth continuing, the people in anger
took the image out into the street, took off its costly clothing,
and gave it a public whipping. Just then a severe
thunder and hail storm came up; vivid flashes of lightning
played around them, and the hail destroyed their crops and
gardens. Greatly frightened, the ignorant people hastened
to re-clothe the image, and prostrate themselves before it in
most abject submission. The enclosure in front of these
churches, and especially the floor of the church itself, is the
favorite burial-place of the people, the holiest place of all
being near the altar. Nearness to the altar is graded by the
amount of money paid.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church, removed from competition
with Protestantism, is a wisely constructed machine for
extorting money out of the fears and superstitions of an ignorant
people. Baptism, confession, blessings, anointing,
burials, and mass must all be paid for at a round price. The
weeping friends bring the corpse of the loved one and set
down the bier before the closed gates of the church. Then
money is laid upon the corpse. Again and again has a
priest been known to look out, and if he judged that the
money was not as much as the friends could afford to pay,
refuse to open the gate, and nothing is left for the friends
but to continue adding money to the sum previously collected
until the rapacity of the priest is satisfied. An ordinary
funeral in a churchyard will cost one hundred dollars,
if the family has that much. To be buried in some of
the churches costs from five hundred dollars to five thousand
dollars, according to position. The corpse is carried
on a board or bier (they do not generally use coffins), to the
place of burial. If the priest goes to the house, he walks in
front of the funeral procession. He has on a scarlet dress
with a white over-skirt. At his side is a small boy similarly
dressed, tinkling a bell. A few yards in the rear is a
second priest, dressed in scarlet and white, swinging a
burning censer. Around him is grouped a motley crowd of
men, women, and children, carrying lighted candles, the
men and boys with uncovered heads, and behind all are
men firing muskets into the air to frighten away the devil,
who is supposed to be hovering around, waiting a chance to
seize the spirit of the departed one. If the corpse is that of
a child, it is covered with flowers (the corpse of such is
called an angel). From two to four children walk with the
bearers. Behind these are other children, who are considered
more holy than the rabble that follow. These are followed
by four children carrying a richly dressed saint under
a canopy. If the family are able to pay for it, the priest
comes out to meet the procession, and sprinkles holy water
over the corpse, then into the grave. After this the corpse
is slid off the board into the grave with but little ceremony,
and some dirt thrown upon it. Men then get into the grave
with a heavy maul and pack the dirt down solid; then more
dirt is thrown in and packed down. This is continued until
the grave is filled up level with the rest of the floor of the
church. The corpses are placed three or four deep in the
same spot, and oftentimes the bones of previous burials are
thrown up to make room for the new comer. In one instance
that came to light, the spade clave in two the head
of a child and threw it out. Nearly all the old churches I
have visited smell like a charnel house. A few years ago
the legislature of New Mexico forbid further burials in the
churches.</p>

<p>With the advent of railways, miners and Americans, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
peculiar and old-time customs of the country will speedily
disappear, and a new era dawn upon the people. Great
changes are rapidly taking place, and New Mexico is waking
up from the sleep of centuries.</p>

<p>January 1, 1881, there were 658 miles of railway in operation,
which has been greatly increased since. During 1880
the yield of the mines was $711,300. At the same time there
were 400,000 head of cattle and 5,000,000 sheep on its pasture
lands. Population, 118,430. The census of 1880 gives 38 Roman
Catholic, 7 Presbyterian, and 1 Baptist churches; and
not mentioned in the census report, the writer knows of
several Methodist and Episcopalian churches.</p>

<p>In 1849, Rev. Henry W. Reed, a Baptist minister, opened
a school at Santa Fe.</p>

<p>In 1850 Rev. E. G. Nicholson commenced a Methodist mission
at Santa Fe, which was abandoned two years after.</p>

<p>In 1857 Rev. W. J. Kephart, a Presbyterian minister, was
sent to New Mexico in the anti-slavery interests, and became
editor of the Santa Fe <i>Gazette</i>. In 1852 Rev. Samuel Gorman,
a Baptist minister, entered the Territory and commenced
a mission at Laguna Pueblo.</p>

<p>These missions were all abandoned at the beginning of
the rebellion.</p>

<p>In 1866 Protestant missions were resumed by Rev. D. F.
McFarland, a Presbyterian minister sent to Santa Fe.</p>

<p>In 1869 the writer of this article was appointed Superintendent
of Presbyterian Missions for New Mexico, Colorado,
Utah, Wyoming and Montana. The present Presbyterian
strength is eighteen ministers, of whom six are Mexicans.</p>

<h2><a name="SPECULATION_IN_THEOLOGYH" id="SPECULATION_IN_THEOLOGYH"></a>SPECULATION IN THEOLOGY.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p class='center'>By the <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> R. S. STORRS, D. D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There are two schemes of religious thought generically in
the world, as there has been—and are now to some extent—two
systems of astronomical speculation, one obtaining in
uncivilized countries, and the other in civilized. One system
of astronomical speculation takes the earth as the
center around which the heavens revolve. That seems according
to our senses; that is the architecture of the heavens
according to the natural man. When the Rev. Mr. Jasper,
at Richmond, insists that “the sun do move,” he seems
to have the judgment and the sense of every seeing man
with him. [Laughter.] And we know what comes of it,—uninterpreted
and unintelligible and contradictory motions
in all the sky; a baffled heaven scribbled o’er with cycle
and epicycle. The other system of astronomical speculation
takes its start from the sun as the center and the governor
of the planetary system, and finds that sun himself, with
all his dependent orbs, marching onward through the heavens.
And we know what comes of that. (There came a
book from Dr. Hill, years ago, which I read with the intensest
interest, concerning the relation of the stars.) [Applause.]
There comes order and harmony in all the system
of the heavens. We measure and weigh the planet in its
course. The astronomer catches the comet in its far flight,
measures its motion and predicts its course and its return.
The butterfly floating in the air is balanced against the sun.
Every shell on the beach, every bud on the tree, is brought
into relation with the farthest nebula whose lace-work
stains the distant azure. It is the astronomy of science; it
is the astronomy of advanced and cultivated thought.</p>

<p>There are two systems of religious speculation. The one
takes man as its center and starting-point, regarding him
as a finished fact, practically. In its grosser forms it does
not profess to know, as we have been told by the brother
who preceded me, whence he came; but it suspects that his
nature is evolved out of the brutal. It does not know
whither he is going; but it treats the future as the scoffing
French sceptic treated it, as at best “a grand Perhaps.” It
does not know about God, or whether there be any God
other than the sum of universal forces. It has no moral
law except a general average of probable experiences. And
so it comes to men and tells them to go on and live as they
list. It tells them that there is no fear of retribution, no
need of atonement, and it has no place in all its compass
for any doctrine of regeneration and of the Holy Spirit of
God. I do not mean, of course, that everybody who holds
this system will accept fully my statement of it. In fact it
is sometimes hard to find out exactly how they state it, or
what they mean by their statements themselves. I am reminded
occasionally of the man who had a clock which
somebody criticised, saying, “Your clock, Mr. Jones, does
not keep good time.” “Why,” said he, “it does keep perfectly
good time, only you do not understand it. The fact
is that when the hands on that clock point to twelve, then it
strikes three, and what that means is that it wants twenty
minutes to seven. [Laughter and applause.] Now if you
will keep that in mind, you will hit the right time in every
instance.” [Laughter.] Well, I intend to speak very seriously,
and yet I cannot help being reminded by some of the
language which is made use of in some of these what-we-call
agnostic publications, into which the richest Christian
words are sometimes brought as if to give a kind of artificial
and fictitious consecration to the doctrine which I
think a detestable doctrine underneath,—I can not help
being reminded of a very careful paraphrase which was
made by a very bright and faithful Indian girl at the school
at Hampton. Her teacher told her—she did all of this innocently,
of course—to take a certain passage of Roman
history and write a paraphrase of it in her own words. So
she went at it; and when the teacher read the paraphrase
she was astounded at finding this statement in it: That “on
a certain time the city was made sick by cooking the entrails
of animals.” Well, what on earth that meant she
could not imagine, nor how it got into this paraphrase, until
she turned to the original passage and then she found the
statement that “at a certain time the city was disturbed by
intestine broils.” [Great laughter and applause.]</p>

<p>Now, over against that system stands the theology
which starts with God as the center, as the Lord and Sovereign
and Judge, as well as the Creator of the earth and men
upon it; and it takes what God declares, in that which
the history of the world declares to be his Word, and what
the devout spirit reverently accepts as the Word of God,
concerning himself and man, and man’s need, and the hereafter.
Here inspiration and redemption, regeneration by
the Holy Spirit, retribution in the future, time as the proof
of eternity, come vividly before us as the thoughts of God.
He shows them to us in characters as broad as if he had written
them in a great theodicy of star-fires and enduring orbs
in the heavens. This system of theology does not cast any
discredit on human nature; it exalts it by showing it the
object of divine solicitude. It casts the splendor and the
solemnity of eternity upon the present experience and life
of man; and it gives to the Bible an immeasurable and an
almost inconceivable importance and value.</p>

<p>Now I understand perfectly that the natural tendency of
men is to accept the preceding system, as the natural tendency
of man is to believe that the earth is the center, and
the heavens go around it. Man finds self-consciousness the
first element of thought. The impulse of self-assertion appears
to be the primary impulse of human nature. It is
simply the egotistic man, of whom it might be said, as was
said by a friend of mine, speaking rather roughly and not
very elegantly about a man who was very egotistic, and who
had offended him by his egotism: “I believe that that man
thinks that his house is placed where the leg of the compasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
was put down when the earth was made round.”
[Laughter.] There is a certain tendency in every human
heart to feel that it is central, and that it has rights and
privileges and possibilities belonging to itself inherently, and
with which no being can properly interfere. And civilization
works with its multiple forces and instruments and wealth
in the same direction, taking a man feeling his lordship of
the earth and reminding him more and more, and encouraging
him to feel that he is lord of his destiny, and lord of
the hereafter as well. There are certain philanthropic sentiments
which work in the same direction, no doubt, tending
to make men believe that all will be right hereafter
somehow or other, and that after some possible brief unpleasantness
in the future there will be a universal deliverance
and restoration into holiness and its peace. And the
secular spirit of the time, intense, widening, ever increasing,
moves in the same direction. It enters into literature;
it enters into life on every side; it finds no reality in religion;
it believes it a matter of poetic aspiration, or of cultivated
literary leisure, or of fine speculation, or of social
observance, or possibly of ethics, or more likely of æsthetic
art; but the grand reality of religion, as a bond uniting the
human soul with the divine, it does not recognize or feel. It
is this which gives significance and importance to infidel
harangues; it is this spirit which spreads beneath and behind
them. The harangues are merely the surface pustules,
while the disease is within. They are the red and sulphurous
flames, while the fires are underneath. And yet they
multiply! The business of this city of Portland could not
be carried on on the principles of these harangues. There
is not a bank or an insurance company here that would not
have to shut its doors if it posted within its walls, “This is
an agnostic establishment. [Applause.] It is carried on
upon these principles: that there is no God about whom we
know anything; there is no hereafter probable; man came
out of the monkey; and there is no moral law.” Let such
sentiments prevail in this city, and it would have been
better if the fire of a few years ago had swept away every
house within it, and left nothing but the bay and the beach
on which to plant a new town. And yet men love to crowd
halls and pay money in order to hear these infidel speculations
which are in substance as old as the ages.</p>

<p>And thus it comes to pass that religious thought loses its
power among those who are not directly touched by such
harangues,—that the influence widens continually to make
the Bible a neglected book, and to make the Sabbath a secular
day, to make the Church a mere convocation of people
coming together at leisure to hear a lecture.</p>

<p>It is at such times that the spirit of liberalism, as it is
called, in religious speculations tending all the time to
loosen the bonds and unstring the strength of the Gospel of
Christ, finds opportunity and incitement and comes more
widely to prevail. Liberalism! I repudiate the term. [Applause.]
I do not understand what function liberality has
either in the record or in the interpretation of facts. I do
not understand how he is a liberal mathematician who
makes his calculations bend to the preferences of himself
and of his pupils. I do not understand how he is a liberal
chemist who feels at liberty to play fast and loose with the
principles of his science, and will not quite affirm whether
gunpowder will explode or not when fire touches it. How is
he a liberal chart-maker who rubs out all the reefs and rocks
and bars and warning headlands from his maps, and shows a
smooth coast-line with nothing but smiling shores and welcoming
bays? How is he a liberal interpreter of the globe
who denies the granite above and the fire beneath, and
affirms that the whole is built, if we only knew it, of excellently
selected wood-pulp? What possible province has
liberality in the record of facts or in the interpretation of
them? I understand perfectly what liberality means as
toward the opinions of others who differ from us. I understand
what liberality means as toward the character of
others who are entirely opposed in opinion and in action
to us. Coleridge’s canon has always seemed to me perfectly
to cover the ground. “Tolerate no belief,” he says, “which
you deem false and of injurious tendency, but arraign no
belief. The man is more and other than his belief, and
God only knows how large or how small a part of him the
belief in man may be.” But liberality in the statement of
facts—there we want exactness, we want earnestness, we
want precise fidelity to the truth of things; and there is no
opportunity for what calls itself liberality there. How is it
less liberal to tell a man that strychnine will kill him than
to tell him that it will certainly give him a pain in his
stomach? [Laughter.] How is it less liberal to tell a man
that if he goes over Niagara he goes to a sure death, than
it is to tell him that if he takes that awful plunge he will
almost certainly wet his feet. [Laughter.] No! When a
man comes to me and says, “These are the liberal doctrines;
there is not probably any God; we do not know
where men come from; there is no law above him; there is
no retribution—or if there be any, it is a small one—waiting
for him,” I say, I perfectly understand your doctrines.
There is no reason why I should not. There is nothing immense
or complex or mysterious about them,—in fact, they
are rather thin. [Laughter.] They remind one of the pillows
which one of the waiters stole at a White Mountain
hotel where they didn’t have very solid pillows. They
knew he stole them, because they found them on him, both
of them, in his waistcoat pocket. [Laughter.] We carry
these doctrines very easily in our thought and hand. There
is nothing massive or majestic about them; there is nothing
liberal in them. If a man is true to his convictions, he is
true to them; and he has no right to be liberal in the way
of giving away a part of what he believes, or hiding it under
any mystery of words and imposing upon men with a
thought which is not really his. And when I look at the
drift and working of such doctrines, I find at once that
they tend to build no grand characters; they give no motive
to men for repentance and faith; they do not seek,
they do not tend, to lift man nearer to the level of the holiness
and happiness of God on high; they work only in degradation
of character; they authorize and encourage men
to imitate their grandfathers, which, on that system of
doctrine, is to make beasts of themselves. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>So I turn to the system of truth, which takes God for its
center, his law as our rule, his gospel as our light, his Son
as our Redeemer, and his immortality as the possible and
glorious home of every created being redeemed by the Son
of God and renewed by his Spirit; and I say here is the
gospel of the ancient time and of the present time. You
need not call it antiquated. Everything which is best in
the world is old. Sunshine is as old as the earth itself and
the sun when the fire-mist was rounded into an orb,—the
same to-day, playing on the streets of Portland, as when it
played on the bowers of Paradise. The air is old, pouring
its refreshing currents into our lungs and renewing our life
to-day as in all time past. The great arch of the heavens is
old; it has not been taken down and built up again on modern
brick-work since the creation. These doctrines are old
but full of motion, full of energy as the river is full of
movements,—full of life-giving power, as the sunlight and
the vital air. They are the doctrines out of which the missionary
work sprang,—doctrines in which is all its life
and the spring of its power. They are the doctrines of
Paul, that first great missionary, of whom we heard in
the sermon the other evening. He had strong convictions.
He did not doubt. He knew whom he had believed, and
was persuaded that he was able to keep him and to save
the world. And who is the successor of Paul? Who holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the same faith with him and teaches it with the same
earnest fidelity? I do not care to know especially what he
believed unless I believe it myself. I do not want any uncertain
or broken ice-bridge of outward ordinations between
me and the Apostle; I want to have his faith in my heart
and to preach it with the emphasis with which he preached
it, and then I feel myself a successor of the great missionary
to the Roman Empire. [Applause.]</p>

<p>Our fathers had these convictions and because of them
they gave of their wealth; they prayed, they sacrificed,
they gave themselves to the work. I remember as a lad in
a distant school seeing that man to whom our president
refers—Champion—who went out from a great fortune to
lay his bones in Western Africa in the service of his Master;
and though I was a careless boy, unmindful of these things,
I remember that his face shone almost as the face of Stephen
when he looked up and saw the Lord on high, and the
vision of it has never failed to come back to me whenever I
have heard his name. They gave themselves. The motive
of their missionary work was found in this Gospel of Christ.
This was the instrument by which they accomplished their
work in other lands. This was the instrument by which
Paul wrought his mighty work in his day, and those who
followed him in the Empire and in barbarous tribes, wherever
they could get access to men. It is this gospel which
has built New England. It is this gospel which, under the
power of the Spirit of God, is to change the earth—this
gospel and nothing else.</p>

<p>Do not let us mask its doctrines in any mystery of words.
Do not let us evaporate its doctrines into any thin mist of
speculation. Do not let us emasculate it of its energy by
taking away any of its vital forces. It seems to me that to
state this gospel in novel forms and doubtful forms, in order
to conciliate unbelief, is very much like the woman’s wisdom
who kept the burglars out of the house by leaving all
the valuables on the doorstep. [Laughter.] It seems to me
that we shall have no inspiration in us, no great powerful
impulse to the work, and no instrument to work with in
that work, except as the old gospel of man, not a cultivated
monkey but a fallen prince, of God’s law binding on him,
of the light of the near eternity flashing on his spirit, of the
cross of Christ and its redemptive efficacy, of the Spirit of
God with his renewing power—except as this old gospel is
not merely in our hands or on our lips, but is in our brains
and in our hearts; and then we shall conquer. [Applause.]</p>

<p>Men may object to it, of course—men object to everything.
I remember a gentleman on the Hudson who took a querulous
Englishman—not a Canadian, [laughter]—who had been
finding fault with everything from the constitution of our
government down to the shape of the toes of our shoes, out
to see from his place the magnificent autumnal forests on
the other side of the river, and the forests on the Hudson
at this season of the year are as if thousands of
rainbows had fallen to the earth and lodged. Said he,
“Isn’t that magnificent?” “Well, yes, that is—yes, that is
very fine; but don’t you think now that it is just a little tawdry,
perhaps?” [Laughter.] There is nothing men may
not object to in the works or in the word of God, if their
hearts set them in that direction. No matter for the objection!
The Gospel of Christ, instinct with power, coming
from the heart, coming on the earnest word of him who believes
it, goes through objections as the cannon ball goes
through mists. Do not let us doubt or fear concerning its
success, if we hold it as the fathers held it. Men object to
the atonement; why, it has been the life of so many millions
of human hearts that the multitudes on high are now
uncounted and incomputable. They object to the doctrine
of regeneration; that is the doctrine which more than any
other exalts man’s nature, showing the royalty of it, the
greatness of it, its possibilities, and the glory of its future.</p>

<p>Of course men may object. Do not let us be disturbed;
but always remember that, with the word of God within us
and the power and providence of God behind us, and the
spirit of God going before us to open ways for our progress,
victory is sure. Christ seemed insane in his aim at the
beginning. Speaking a few words orally to his disciples;
writing no line unless he wrote one on the sand; only uttering
his thought in syllables that seemed dissipated in the
air, and aiming by that to conquer the world to his truth,—it
seemed like expecting the whistle of a boy in these mountain
valleys to go reverberating as thunder over all the
earth in all the centuries. But he did it. It seemed insane
to undertake to build a kingdom by gathering a few scattered
followers here and there, and especially a small nucleus
of obscure and uneducated men bound together by
nothing but the simple sacrament of eating bread and
drinking wine in memory of him,—without saint or standard
or army or treasure or navy or counselors or forum,—it
seemed like building another Lebanon with shovelfuls of
sand, or building another Jerusalem with charred sticks
and straws. But he did it. His kingdom already is in all
the earth. The proudest empire which sets itself against it,
shivers in the contact. Napoleon saw this on the Island
of St. Helena. Comparing himself as a man ruling in the
world with Christ as a Godlike person, said he, “He is God
and not man.” He has done the work thus far; he is to do
it in the future, if you and I adhere to the gospel, if from all
our pulpits reverberate the echoes of this great meeting, if
the force which is here assembled goes forth to testify of
that system of religion of which God is the centre and head,
which has its grandest trophy and symbol in the cross of
Christ, and which opens the vast and near eternity to the
apprehension of every soul conscious of unconfessed sins,
and to the desiring and exulting hope of every soul that has
found rest in Christ—the gospel that is to fill the world at last.</p>

<p>I remember when a lad, forty years ago last spring, coming
for the first time into this beautiful Portland harbor
from Boston by the boat. The night was windy and rough.
The cabin was confined, the boat was small; and very early
in the morning I went up on deck. There was nothing but
the blue waste around, dark and threatening, and the
clouded heavens above. At last suddenly on the horizon
flashed a light, and then after a little while another, and
then a little later another still, from the light-houses along
the coast; and at last the light at the entrance of this harbor
became visible just as “the fingers of the dawn” were
rushing up into the sky. As we swept around into the harbor
the sunrise gun was fired from the cutter or corvette
lying in the harbor, the band struck up a martial and inspiring
air, the great splendor of the rising sun flooded the
whole view, and every window-pane on these hills, as seen
from the boat, seemed to be a plate of burnished gold let
down from the celestial realms.</p>

<p>Ah! my friends, we are drawing nearer to the glory of the
latter day. I have thought of that vision often. I thought
of it then in my early carelessness, as representing what
might be conceived of the entrance into heaven. I have
thought of it as I have stood by the bed of the dying and
seen their faces flush and flash in a radiance that I could not
apprehend. I have thought of it this week as I have been
in these meetings. The lights are brightening along the
coast; the darkness is disappearing; the harbor is not far
off; the Sun of Righteousness is to arise in all the earth,
and the golden glory of the new Jerusalem is to be established
here. Let it be ours in that great day to remember
that we held the faith, we triumphed by the Cross, we stood
with Paul and with the Son of God, taking God’s revelation
for our inspiration and doing our work under that mighty
impulse.</p>

<p>And unto God be all the praise. [Great applause.]</p>

<p>Now the clear, transparent air permits heat to be shot off,
or rayed through it with great freedom. But it does not
readily receive heat “by conveyance,” so long as it is still.
If you put your hand into still air which is as cold as a cold
metal knob, you do not know that the air is so chill as the
metal, because it does not make your hand so cold. The
heat is not conveyed away from your hand as quickly.
When air is <i>moving</i>, instead of being still, the case is, however,
altogether altered. A current of air, or wind, carries
away heat from warm bodies very quickly as it blows over
them. It does so because each fresh little particle of air
which is pressed against them, receives its own share of the
heat, and conveys it away, leaving fresh particles to come
up in their turn, and do the same thing. A pint of boiling
water in a metal pot placed in a strong wind having fifty
degrees of heat, would lose all its excess of heat as soon
again as it would if standing in still air having the same
warmth. The old plan of cooling hot tea or broth by blowing
it, is correct in principle, though not in accordance with
good taste.</p>

<p>The laboratory of the living animal body has the supply
of its fuel, and the capacity of its air-blasts, so arranged that
just about as much heat is supplied through its internal furnace,
as is lost from its surface by “raying off” and “conveyance,”
when the surrounding air has a warmth of sixty
degrees of the heat scale, and when its surface is somewhat
protected by a light covering of clothing, to lessen the
rapidity with which the heat is shot off and conveyed away.
The heat is then produced as rapidly in the internal furnace,
as it is thrown off from the outer surface, and the consequence
is that the animal <i>feels comfortably warm</i>. It
only feels uncomfortably <i>hot</i>, when more heat is produced in
the furnace of the living laboratory than can be scattered
through its surface. And it only feels uncomfortably <i>cold</i>
when more heat is scattered from the surface than can be
kept up through the burning of the inner furnace.</p>

<p>But in winter time the cold external air carries away
heat much more quickly from the surface of living animals,
than the warmer external air does in summer time. Here,
then, is a little difficulty to be met, if the warmth of the
body is to be kept precisely the same in both seasons. It is
requisite that it should be always maintained at the same
point, because that point is the one which is most suitable
for the operations which are being carried on in the
vessels and chambers of its laboratory. Nature has two
distinct ways in which she insures this end.</p>

<p>In the first place, are you not aware that you get more
hungry in winter than you do in summer time? All living
animals have pretty much the same experience as yourself
in this particular, and the reason is that nature intends,
during the cold season, to have more fuel introduced into
the supply-pipes of the body for the warming of its structures.
The furnace of the laboratory gets quickened in a
small degree; its slow fires are fanned into slightly increased
activity, more fuel is burned, and so more heat is
generated to meet the greater demand for it, dependent on
the influence of the external cold.</p>

<p>But nature also thickens the clothing of animals during
the cold season, and so affords increased obstruction,
through which the escaping heat has to force its way.
Have you not observed the sleek silky coat which the horse
wears through the summer, and then noticed at the beginning
of winter how this sleek coat is exchanged for a thick,
fuzzy shag, that looks more like wool than hair? The warm
winter coat economizes the heat produced in the furnace of
the living body, and keeps it from being scattered to waste
as quickly as it is through the sleek summer coat. This is
nature’s other plan of meeting the difficulty brought about
by the changing temperature of the air. Nearly all animals
belonging to temperate and cold climates have this change
of apparel provided for them in spring and autumn, but in
some cases the change is rendered very striking in consequence
of a summer garment of bright gay colors being replaced
by a winter one of pure and spotless white. The
fierce tyrant of the ice land himself, the polar bear, has a
dingy yellow coat during the summer, but puts on furs as
snowy as his own realms when once the summer sun has
disappeared. These white winter furs are always warmer
than dark ones. Birds which do not migrate to warmer
regions of the earth in the cold season, have winter and
summer suits of apparel, just in the same way as quadrupeds.
In the winter a lining of the thick, soft white down
is added beneath the outer feathers. There is one little
bird which comes to England in the late autumn, driven
there by the still greater cold further north, and which is
familiarly known as having two remarkably different costumes
for his English and his foreign residence. In England
the snow-bunting appears with a white body and tail,
but abroad and in summer time he is distinguished by a
brilliant black tail and back, and a body and head of pure
white.</p>

<p>Man follows the example which nature has set before
him, in the matter of clothing. He prepares himself stout
warm garments for winter time, and thin cool ones for the
summer; and not only this; in the hottest regions of the
earth, where there is most sunshine, he commonly goes
nearly naked, while in the coldest regions, near the poles,
he puts on the heaviest and warmest woolens and furs that
he can procure. Now this is one reason why man has been
<i>apparently</i> so uncared for by nature in the particular of
clothing. The seeming indifference and carelessness is
really consideration of the highest kind. All the different
races of the lower animals have their own narrow tracts assigned
them for their residence. In these tracts there is
no very extreme diversity of temperature, and provision is
therefore easily made to adapt their clothing to it just so far
as is required. The human race, on the other hand, is intended
to cover the entire earth, and to subdue it; to spread
itself from the burning tropics to the frigid poles. The heat
which has to be borne in the tropics, is as much greater than
that which is experienced near the poles in winter time, as
boiling water is hotter than ice. At the poles, one hundred
degrees of frost often occur. In India, there are occasionally
one hundred and thirty degrees of heat under the canvas
of tents. It therefore becomes an affair of almost absolute
necessity, that the skin of the widely scattered lords
of creation should be as unencumbered as possible, and that
warm clothing should have to be prepared and added as a
covering whenever circumstances call for its use. The head
only, of the human being, has a natural fur garment. This
part of the body is covered with hair, because the most delicate
portion of the entire frame, the brain, is contained
within it. The skull is protected by hair, that the brain
may not be hurt by too sudden a change from cold to heat,
or from heat to cold.</p>

<p>There is another advantage attending upon the arrangement
which has left human beings dependent upon an artificial
supply of clothing, and which has ordained that they
shall come into the world with naked skins. In consequence
of this arrangement it is very easy to secure that
amount of cleanliness which is necessary for the preservation
of the health of such delicately framed creatures.
The artificial clothes can be altogether changed at will, and
they can be washed and aired, as they never could be if
they were inseparably attached to the skin. Then, too,
they can be removed from the skin in the early morning, or
at convenient intervals, and its surface can be thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
cleansed and purified by bathing with water. Just think
of the difference of going into a bath of refreshing water unencumbered
by clothes, and of doing the same with thick,
dabby garments clinging about you, and having to shake
yourselves like great Newfoundland dogs when you come
out; and also recall to mind the pleasure you experience
every time you change soiled linen for clean, and you will
become sensible of how much you owe to beneficent nature
for having left you destitute of the feathers of the bird, or
the fur of the bear. The extreme importance of making a
fair use of this privilege has been already alluded to in its
proper place.</p>

<p>But nature has effected yet another very bountiful provision
for the comfort and safety of her tender charge, the
living human animal. Even when only covered by very
light clothing, it is possible human beings may be placed
in air which is so warm, that heat is not carried off from
their bodies so fast as it is produced in the interior furnace.
In India, it sometimes happens that the air gets to be even
hotter than the living body. All movement of the air,
then, heats, rather than cools. Under such circumstances,
nature adopts a very effectual course to prevent warmth
from collecting more and more in the frame, until a disagreeable
and injurious amount has been reached. Having
first reduced the supply of fuel to the smallest limits consistent
with keeping the fire going, by lessening the appetite,
and by taking away the craving for heating food, and
having given a hint to adopt such outer coverings for the
body as are as little obstructive of the passage of heat as
possible, the heat drenches the surface of the frame abundantly
with moisture, which has the power to cool by its
ready evaporation. Take a small piece of wet linen and
lay it upon your forehead, or upon your arm, leaving it
freely exposed to the air, and you will find, that as the
moisture evaporates from the linen, your skin underneath
will feel colder and colder. The heat of the skin is used up
in converting the moisture of the linen into steam, exactly
as the heat of a fire is used up in converting the
water of a kettle into steam when this is made to boil.
The steam flies away with the warmth of the skin very
rapidly, and consequently the skin soon comes to feel cold.
Now, when the body gets to be very warm, and the over-heated
blood is rapidly pouring through the channels of its
supply pipes, then the three millions of little holes or pores,
which lie upon its surface, are opened, and floods of vapor
and water are poured through them, producing just the
same kind of effect as wet linen would do. This action is
termed “perspiration,” or a “steaming through” the pores
of the skin. The breathing blows up, or fans the slow furnace
contained within the living animal frame, and so
heats it above the surrounding air. The perspiration carries
away portions of this heat when it has been raised too
high, and so cools the heated body down. Some moisture
also escapes as steam from the lungs and through the
mouth in breathing, thus assisting the perspiring skin in
its office of diminishing the excessive warmth of the body.
You have often seen dogs, which have been heated by running,
pant with opened mouths and outstretched tongues,
the vapor steaming forth from their gaping throats. Dogs
cool themselves in this way because they have very little
perspiration passing through their skins. Their perspiration
is really from their throats, rather than from their
skins. Human beings sometimes lose, in hot weather, as
much as five pints of water in twenty-four hours, by exhalation
through the lungs and skin.</p>

<p>Give me now, good reader, your close attention for just a
few minutes while I return to the notion with which we
started on beginning the consideration of this subject,
so that I may fit it into its right place, and leave it well
packed away with the other notions that we have gained,
while studying the value and uses of air, water, and food.
Your body is a living laboratory, formed of an enormous
quantity of little chambers and vessels. From a strong central
force-pump, placed in the middle of that laboratory,
liquefied food, or blood, is streamed out through branching
supply-pipes to the several chambers, to carry to them the
materials that have to be operated upon in their cavities for
the production of animal power and warmth. The force-pump
acts by repeated short strokes, but the liquefied food
flows through chambers of the laboratory in continuous,
even currents, because the supply-pipes are made of yielding
and elastic substance, like India-rubber, and not of
hard, stiff substance, like metal or wood. As the liquefied
food gushes out from the force-pump, the elastic walls
of the supply-pipes are stretched by the gush, but directly
afterwards they shrink back again, as India-rubber would
do, shut close a valve that prevents all return of the liquid
into the force-pump, and so compel the liquid to run
onwards in the other direction, through the pipes. Before
the shrinking in of the pipes has altogether ended, the
force-pump renews its stroke, and so the onward flow of the
liquid never stays, although the pump has to make beat
after beat. The liquefied food gushes out from the force-pump
with a speed of about a foot in each second; but it
has to supply such an enormous host of small chambers in
the remote parts of the laboratory, that it does not flow
through them with a speed greater than an inch in a minute.
This, however, is no disadvantage, as it affords plenty
of time for the full carrying out of all the intended changes
in those chambers, whereby animal power and warmth are
to be produced.</p>

<p>Remember, then, that as your heart beats in your chest,
second after second, the red blood flushes through every
crevice and every fibre of your living frame, just as it does
through your cheek when it is crimsoned with a blush.
Seventy or eighty times every minute, your beating heart
pumps, and constantly, so long as you are alive, the flushing
blood streams on everywhere. The blood, however,
streams on in this continuous way, because its flow is not
stopped, even when it has reached the remotest chambers
and fibers. The trunks of the supply-pipes divide into
branching twigs, which get very fine indeed where they are
in connection with the working chambers of the laboratory,
and which then lead on into return-pipes, that are gathered
together into enlarging trunks, These, in their turn, are
collected into main tubes which end in the cavity of the
heart. At the extremity of these main trunks of the
return-pipes, valves are so placed as to prevent the pumping
action of the heart from forcing the blood back into
them. Thus, as your heart pumps, swelling out and drawing
in its walls, the blood flows into its cavity by the
return-pipes, and is squeezed out therefrom through the
supply-pipes. It always streams in one direction. It circulates
through the living frame which it flushes; that is,
it goes in an endless circle, now through the heart, now
through the supply-pipes, now through the return-pipes,
and now starts once again through the heart.</p>

<p>But as your blood thus circulates, through your living
frame, fresh nourishment, newly dissolved food, is added in
some places to its streams; in other places nourishment and
fuel are taken from it to furnish the active chambers of the
laboratory with warmth and power; in other places worn-out
substance is added to it to be carried away in its
current; and at other places this worn-out substance
is poured away from it through the outlets provided for its
removal. The principal outlets through which the waste
of your living laboratory is poured away, have been already
spoken of in detail—they are the pores of the skin, the
drains of the laboratory; and the pores of the lungs, that
with the mouth form the chimney of the laboratory through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
which the smoke and the vapors from the burned fuel fly
away. In addition to these outlets, there is, however, another
series by which some denser matters, which can not
be got through either the skin-pores or the lungs, are
streamed away. This series is continually in operation,
but the details of its arrangements are so ingeniously
planned, that it accommodates its work to the demand of
each passing instant. When, for instance, the perspiring
pores of the skin are widely open for the cooling of the
frame, and an increased amount of liquid is consequently
steamed away through them, then these outlets are narrowed;
but when, on the other hand, the skin-pores are
closed, or when any extra flood of liquid is thrown into the
interior of the frame during cold weather, then the additional
outlets at once are brought into very active play.</p>

<p>Now, just imagine the case of a large town, in which
there is a certain quantity of waste liquid needing to be
carried away through drain-pipes every day, but in which
also there occur occasional excessive floods of rain, which
must have a way of escape provided for them whenever
they happen. How clever you would think it if some
skillful engineer fixed valves in the drain-pipes of that
town, which kept themselves fast closed under ordinary
circumstances, but which opened of their own accord whenever
the pressure of an extra flood came, and so allowed
the excess of liquid to flow safely and freely away. Such
has really been the proceeding of the skillful Engineer of
your living frame. Your body is exposed to the risk of occasional
excessive floods. When the weather is very cold,
for instance, the pores of your skin are closed, and not more
than a single pint of liquid can force its way out through
them, in the place of the four pints which would pass in
warm weather. Much of the water which would otherwise
have escaped from the channels of the supply-pipes, then remains
in them, coursing round in the progress of the circulation.
Sometimes, too, in all probability you will be
tempted to swallow an unreasonable quantity of liquid, beyond
any demand the mere process of cooling an over-heated
frame can require. But whenever you have thus
set up an unusual internal flood, sluice-gates are opened,
and through these the excess is rapidly poured until the
flood is got rid of. In those parts of your body which have
been named the kidneys, there are pores through which
waste liquid is always draining, without being turned into
vapor or steam; but in the kidneys there are also chambers
composed of very fine walls, which are strong enough to
prevent fluid from passing through them when it is only
pressed by a gentle force, but which are not strong enough
to do so when the pressure becomes greater in consequence
of the over-flooding of the supply-pipes. The kidneys are
the sluice-gates of your body, provided with outlets for
common use, and with self-acting valves which come into
operation upon occasions of excessive flood.</p>

<p>Thus astonishing, then, is the care which has been taken
in perfecting the arrangements of the heating service of
that complicated laboratory, your living body. Fuel is
thrown into an internal furnace, more or less plentifully,
according to need. The fuel is there burned, and fanned by
air-blasts, which are strengthened or weakened as the occasion
may require. The heat produced by the burning is
economized by external packings and wrappings, or it is
scattered by the opening of evaporating pores on the external
surface, and by the drenching of that surface with
steaming moisture; and self-acting valves are provided to
regulate the quantity of liquid contained in the supply-pipes,
so that the cooling pores may never be forced into
mischievous activity by the mere pressure of excess in their
channels, at a time when the body is already sufficiently
chill.</p>

<p>When cold is suddenly applied to the previously warm
skin of the living body, it shuts up all the perspiring pores
at once, and then empties its supply-pipes of their streaming
blood inwards. You know how pale and numb your
skin becomes on a cold frosty day, when you stand quietly
in the chilling air. That is because the cold squeezes all the
blood out of the small vessels of your skin. But where do
you suppose the squeezed-out blood goes to? It flows
directly into the several internal parts, choking up and
overloading their channels. If the skin be soon made
warm again, the overloaded parts of the inside once more
get emptied, and recover their usual freedom; but if it be
kept cold, then their overloading and choking continues,
and great discomfort is experienced. All kinds of inflammations
and disorders are produced in this way. What are
commonly known as colds are internal obstructions of this
nature. Cold in the head is an affection in which the lining
of the nostrils is overcharged with stagnating blood.
Sore throat is caused by a similar condition in the lining of
the throat. And cough by the same state in the lining of
the vessels and cavities of the chest.</p>

<p>The mere application of a chill temperature to the skin is
not alone, however, enough to give a cold. This result
chiefly comes when the application has been made while
the body is in a weakened or exhausted state, and therefore
has not the power to resist and overcome the internal disturbance
of the even blood-flow. Colds are nearly always
caught in consequence of a sudden exposure of the body to
a chill, either when it is in a state of exhaustion and
fatigue from sustained exertion, or when it has been for
some time previously over-heated. Excess of heat itself
soon produces exhaustion, and depression of the strength
and the powers of life. When a chill is applied to the skin
while the body is fresh and strong, as, for instance, when a
man pours cold water over himself the instant he gets out
of a warm bed in the morning, after a sound and refreshing
sleep, it does no harm, for this reason: First, the blood is
driven away from the supply-pipes of the skin by the cold,
and flows inwards; but the refreshed heart, then becoming
sensible of its arrival, rouses itself to increased effort, and
prevents obstruction by pumping on the liquid more vigorously.
By this means blood is soon sent back again to the
skin in great abundance, and makes it glow with renewed
warmth. It is only when the cold is very severe, or very
long continued, that this re-action, as it is called, would be
hindered, and internal disorder be likely to be set up.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one of the advantages of employing warm
clothing. It prevents the catching of cold by protecting
the skin from sudden chills at a time when the internal
parts of the frame are depressed and unable to meet, without
injury, the effects which follow upon it. If at any time
you are very weary, and very warm, remember, then, that
you must keep yourself warm by drawing more clothes
round you, or by some other plan. Want of attention
to this very simple proceeding, or absolute ignorance that
it ought to be adopted, is among the common means
whereby men lay up for themselves disease and suffering,
and cause sickness to take the place of health.</p>

<p>How constantly it happens, at the very first appearance
of fine weather in spring, that sore throats and coughs and
colds are met with everywhere. This is nearly always because
people are then tempted to throw aside the warm
clothing which they have used through the winter, and so
to leave their skins very much more exposed to the influences
of the sudden chills, which are quite sure to occur at
this time. Just observe what nature herself does in this
matter. She does not take off the horse’s warm coat the
moment the spring sunshine bursts out in the sky. She
compels him to keep it upon his back, at the risk of his being
a good deal encumbered by it now and then, because it
is better he should submit to this small inconvenience for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
time, rather than be exposed to the danger of a grave disease.
As you may advantageously take a lesson from the
bee as to the management of fresh air in your dwellings, so
you may advantageously go to the quadruped to learn how
to manage the alteration of your clothing at the change of
the seasons. When you see the horse putting on his fine
silken garment for summer, follow his example; but until
you do see this, be wise, and still keep within the protection
of your winter wools and furs.</p>

<p>There is another plan by which people every day expose
themselves to the danger of catching cold, and of so falling
into disease. They commonly sit in very draughty rooms;
apartments which are warmed by bright fires, but which
are at the same time chilled by cold wind rushing in at
large crannies and crevices, far beyond the quantity which
is needed for the mere supply of pure air. Such rooms are
warm and cold climates brought together in a nutshell.
There is a scorching summer near the fire, and a freezing
winter near the window at the same instant. Merely walking
about the room therefore takes the body in a moment
from one climate to another, and this must happen sometimes
when the body is not prepared to meet, and accommodate
itself to, the change. A chilled surface, and internal
obstructions result, and colds and diseases follow
very soon. The inside of rooms should be in winter time
very much what they are in the summer season; that is,
not too hot, but equally warm in all parts, and with a sufficient
current of air passing through them to keep them
pure, although not with enough to set up dangerous
draughts. If there are draughts, then the protection of
warm clothing must be constantly employed, to prevent
the chilling influence from attacking the skin. Warm and
undraughty dwelling-rooms are the natural allies of warm
clothes in health-preserving power.</p>

<p>There is another very excellent companion and helper of
warm clothes in this good work. This helper is “exercise.”
If, when you are weary and warm, and have no additional
clothes to draw round you on the instant to prevent a chill,
you sit down or stand still in the cold wind, you will be
nearly sure to catch cold, and to be made ill. But if, on
the other hand, you keep moving about until you can
either clothe yourself more warmly, or go into a warm
room, then you will be almost as certain to escape without
harm. Exercise aids the heart in keeping the blood moving
briskly, and if at any time there is an inclination for
the blood-flow to stagnate and get obstructed internally,
then exercise overcomes the obstruction, and sends the
lagging blood cheerily on toward all parts of the frame, and
back toward the skin. Brisk exercise thus possesses the
power to overcome mischief, as well as to prevent it. Its
influence in quickening and sustaining the flow of the
blood-streams through the supply-pipes of the body, necessarily
leads in the end to the strengthening of every structure
in the frame, and to the rousing of every operation
that is carried on in the living laboratory. Every one who
values the blessing of health and strength will do well, if
his daily task is not one of exertion in the open air, to
make such a task for himself. One hour at least out of the
twenty-four should be spent in quickening the blood-streams,
and in deepening the breathing by walking briskly
in some open space where the fresh winds of heaven have
free play.</p>

<p>But we will now imagine that in ignorance of all these
particulars, or in consequence of some long-continued exertion
and exposure which the demands of duty made it
altogether impossible for you to avoid, you have caught a
cold, and are beginning to suffer from a sore throat, or a
cough, or some other sign that matters within are not as
they should be. What, under such circumstances, ought
you to do to stop the cold, and get rid of it, before serious
disorder is brought about? Here, again, warm clothing is
of the highest value. If the chilled surface be at once
closely covered up, and be kept covered, the blood is soon
drawn back to the skin, and the internal obstructions are in
this way overcome. The best possible way to get rid of a
cold quickly, for those who can follow it, is to go to bed as
soon as it begins, and to keep there until the cold is cured.
If you can not follow this plan, then <i>drink as little of any
fluid as you can</i> for four or five days, and there will soon be
not enough blood, as regards quantity, in your body, to
keep internal parts overcharged, and they will be relieved,
and you will get well. There is this evil in the first plan of
curing a cold: people who have lain in bed for some time,
come out of it with the pores of their skins more than
usually opened, and more than usually disposed to suffer
from any fresh chill. People who pursue the second plan
may be exposed in any way without meeting this risk.</p>

<p>There are thus, then, golden rules for the management of
the clothing, as well as for the management of the feeding,
which all people should have stamped on their understandings,
and engraved upon their memories. These are:</p>

<p>Follow the example which nature sets, and wear thicker
clothing in cold weather than in warm.</p>

<p>Do not lay aside the warm clothing of winter, as soon as
fine, mild weather seems to have begun, but wait until you
see that nature is taking their winter garments away from
the birds and the beasts.</p>

<p>Never expose yourself to a chill without extra clothing,
when you are weary, as well as warm.</p>

<p>Never sit in draughts of cold air without putting on extra
clothing.</p>

<p>Keep in brisk exercise when you are unable to avoid currents
of chill air, and are at the same time fatigued by exertion,
and thinly clad.</p>

<p>Never remain in damp clothes longer than you can help.
Damp clothes chill the surface of the body very rapidly by
carrying away its heat as the moisture is turned into steam.
Wet stockings, and boots, or shoes, are injurious, for the
same reason as other kinds of wet clothing. They are not
more dangerous than other kinds of damp garments, but
they have to be encountered much more frequently on account
of the ground often remaining wet for long periods,
when there is no great excess of moisture in the air. Wet
feet produce harm more frequently than wet clothes, because
they are much more common.</p>

<p>By a careful and constant attendance to the principles laid
down in these golden rules, the attacks of many grave diseases
may be avoided, and the advantage which is intended
to result from the influence of warm clothes may be most
certainly secured.</p>

<h3>V.—EGYPT, PHŒNICIA, JUDEA.</h3>

<p><i>Egypt.</i>—According to Bunsen, Egypt is the middle place
in the world’s history. It is connected directly with the
West or Europe, and as directly with the East or Asia.</p>

<p>It is the only country in the great continent of Africa that
forms a link in the history of the world. What education
is to be found in the other parts of Africa, we have
seen in our first chapter on education in the savage tribe.
Of course we reckon the Abyssinian Christians, loosely, in
this designation of Egypt, and consider Carthage as a part of
Phœnician civilization.</p>

<p>Egypt is properly a link in the chain of Asiatic civilization,
although geographically located in Africa. Its history
is full of interaction with the Semitic peoples of Western
Asia, and we find it often in relation with the Hebrews,
the Arabians, and the Phœnicians, and even with the far-off
nations of the Euphrates and Tigris. Finally the Persians
conquer the country under Cambyses, and Egypt is
henceforth Persian, then Macedonian, then Roman, then
Saracen, and finally a Turkish dependency.</p>

<p>The river Nile is the essential feature of Egypt, more particularly
the circumstance of its annual overflow and subsidence.
There is little or no rain in Egypt in all the region
from the mouth of the Nile up to the last tributary it receives
on its way down from the highlands of Abyssinia.
Northward from that branch (the Atbara) the Nile valley is
eight hundred miles long, and the Nile itself with all its
windings flows 1,300 miles, to its mouth.</p>

<p>The copious rains and snows in the mountainous countries
at the south supply fertility by the annual inundation,
which begins in June, attains its greatest height in September,
and then subsides so that the farmers of Egypt can sow
their grain on the waters in October, and by November,
when the waters have subsided, the green blades of wheat
are seen everywhere sprouting through the slimy deposit
left by the river. In March there is an abundant harvest.
Living was so cheap in Egypt that the cost of bringing up a
human being to his twentieth year was not more than four
dollars.</p>

<p>The Egyptian finds it possible to conquer nature and
make it serve him. He builds canals and dykes and regulates
the overflow of the Nile so as to get the utmost service
from the fertilizing power of the rich soil that the Nile
brings down to him. Observation of nature necessary for
the purpose of utilizing the rise of the Nile, leads him to a
knowledge of astronomy, the construction of calendars, and
hydraulic engineering. He understands irrigation, the
construction of canals, dams and reservoirs. He invents
the science of geometry because he has to use the art of
surveying in order to recover his farm after the inundation,
and fix its boundaries. Difficulties that occur in locating
farms that are liable to be washed away by new channels
cut through by freshets, as well as by the covering up and
destruction of old landmarks, lead to a more careful system
of laws on the subject of landed property, as well as rights
and privileges appertaining to its use, than we can find elsewhere
in ancient times.</p>

<p>The greatest contrast exists between the day, which is
very hot and bright with light both direct and reflected, and
the night, which is very dark and cool.</p>

<p>In contrast to the natural changes which annually prevail,
making Egypt first a vast sea of water and then a
blooming garden, the people of Egypt strive for permanency.</p>

<p>Their struggle to control nature is their perpetual education.
They build enormous architectural structures—temples
and pyramids. They love the past and will preserve it
if possible. The pyramid is a gigantic tomb, for the high
priest who is the king.</p>

<p>Not only the king but all good Egyptians shall have
their bodies embalmed and preserved. Their mummies
shall be saved from decay in the gigantic tombs of the hillside,
above the reach of the Nile floods.</p>

<p>Egypt invented the writing by hieroglyphics, and developed
out of that system of picture-writing two other systems
of writing, the Syllabic and Alphabetic. Doubtless
the Phœnicians borrowed their alphabet from the Egyptians,
and diffused a knowledge of it among the peoples
living around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>The priestly caste hold the directive power of Egypt,
They administer the education, and rule in the counsels of
the state, and give character to whatever is Egyptian.</p>

<p>The idea of death is ever present with the Egyptian.
There seems to be some faint idea of its spiritual meaning
in their religion.</p>

<p>The god Osiris dies, slain by Typhon, and yet proves
himself triumphant over death, and attains perfect individuality
after it. In East India there is transmigration of
souls as a punishment for the exercise of appetites and desires
in the life here. The properly prepared soul reaches
extinction in Brahm or in Nirwana. In Egypt, too, transmigration
punishes the individual by delaying his ascent
into the heaven of Osiris, wherein he may become a companion
to that god. While his body does not decay he need
not be born again in another body, and if embalmed properly,
he can avoid transmigration until he lives again with
Osiris.</p>

<p>Egyptian religious ideas are in advance of Persian in the
doctrine of evil. The evil is not a principle of such power
that it is invincible by the Lord of the good.</p>

<p>The thought of death and the death-court which would
decide whether the individual had lived worthily or not,
was the greatest educational influence in Egypt.</p>

<p>If the death-court decided that the deceased was worthy,
his body should be embalmed, and this saved him from
transmigration and secured him ultimate residence with
Osiris.</p>

<p>Hieroglyphics can not express clear abstract ideas, but
only symbols of ideas. Symbolic thought is not sufficient
for science. The Egyptian expresses his ideas in the form
of enigmas or riddles. The Sphinx is the most adequate
expression of his mind. It has the form of a human bust
placed on the body of a lion, rising out of a rock. It expresses
the question of its soul: “What is man? Is he
only a natural being who, like the rock or the animal, belongs
to nature only, and does not escape from it—or does
he rise out of it and attain to individual immortality,
outlasting all the forms of nature?”</p>

<p>Egypt contributed to the spiritual development of all
other lands. It is the great stimulator to the unfolding of
mind in Greece and Rome, and all other nations about the
Mediterranean. It is the great schoolmaster, not in morals
and religion, but in scientific thinking. And yet it did not
itself furnish the completed sciences, but only the limits and
beginnings of science.</p>

<p>Greek literature abounds in exaggerated accounts of the
learning and wisdom of Egypt, and of its appliances for
education. We should believe that the Egyptian priesthood
constituted a sort of university of philosophy, history,
and science.</p>

<p>Arithmetic, geometry, surveying, and mensuration, civil
engineering, language, and writing, and, according to some
accounts, music formed the chief branches of their education,
which varied with the caste. There were scientific
schools for the priests and warriors, at Thebes, Memphis,
and Heliopolis. The education of the common people was
at a low standard. Plato tells us that the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Egyptians learned to read in classes. Diodorus says that
the artisans in particular were taught reading and writing;
and this we may readily believe, when we see that so many
inscriptions had to be made on the walls of buildings, and
on papyrus rolls. It seems that the trades and arts were
learned by children from their parents.</p>

<p>The women looked after the out-of-door affairs, while the
men did the housework, and especially cared for the training
of the children and the work at the loom.</p>

<p>Arithmetic was taught by games and plays, such as trading
apples or pieces of money, guessing at the number of
grains of wheat concealed in the hand, or by arranging pupils
in military lines.</p>

<p>Children went barefoot and almost naked, the climate being
very mild. Psammeticus (B. C. 650) sought to introduce
foreign ideas, especially Greek and Phœnecian, apparently
thinking that something could be gained from those
peoples. Foreign languages were taught under his reign, but
not in other ages.</p>

<p>The sight of what is strange stimulates us to wonder and
reflection. Herodotus, Thales, Pythagoras, Plato, and others
of the wisest of the Greeks speak with reverence of that
part of their education received in Egypt.</p>

<p>After Alexandria was founded by the Macedonian Greeks,
as the commercial emporium of the world, Egypt became
more than ever a center for the collection and distribution
of learning and wisdom for the West and for the East.</p>

<p>The Ptolemies cultivated mathematics, astronomy, medicine,
grammar and history. The great museum founded by
them in 322 B. C., furnished for two hundred years a sort
of dwelling-place and university for the Greek investigators
who resorted to Egypt. Even after Christianity had become
the established religion under the Romans, Alexandria remained
a chief seat of theological controversy.</p>

<p>In this museum there were several large courts surrounded
by colonnades opening inward, and seats under the shady
trees and by cool fountains, were placed for the scholars. The
dwellings of the learned teachers were near by. The famous
library was in the court most retired from the street, and
free from interruption. There the busy scribes copied out
the treasures of the library for the libraries of other lands.</p>

<p>The astronomical observations carried on here surprise us.</p>

<p>The length of a degree on the surface of the earth was
measured as accurately as the perfection of their instruments
permitted, and the circumference of the earth was
calculated by this means. The fact that the earth is round
seems to have been well known long before. Eratosthenes,
the superintendent of the Alexandrian Library, about two
hundred years B. C., computed the obliquity of the ecliptic
to be 23° 51' and 20?, and also measured the distance between
Syene and Alexandria, and the difference in latitude, by
observations on the sun and stars. This gave him data for
the calculation of the size of the earth, which he made to be
about thirty thousand miles.</p>

<p><i>Phœnicia.</i>—Along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean
on the narrow sea-coast at the foot of the Mountains of Lebanon,
were a series of commercial and manufacturing cities,
the seat of the Phœnecians. Tyre, Sidon, Byblus, Berytus,
Tripolis, Aradis were places of great security on the land
side, and afforded great security on the seaward side to the
shipping of their merchants. The manufacture of metallic
goods, glass, linen textures, dyed with the wonderful Tyrian
purple, furnished the home productions wherewith to obtain
the coveted articles of foreign peoples. Phœnicia was the
land of industry and adventurous sailors. The tin from
Cornwall, and the amber even from the Baltic were brought
home through stormy seas and used in manufactures. The
trains of camels loaded with Phœnician wares pierced the
deserts and arrived at the great cities on the Euphrates.
Cyprus, Crete, Carthage, Gades (Cadiz) were settled by
Phœnician colonies. In commerce writing is indispensable,
and the Phœnician borrowed the art of writing from Egypt
and spread it widely over the world.</p>

<p>For a commercial people the education was of a utilitarian
character, especially arithmetic and writing, the commercial
arts. The moral training was peculiar, inasmuch as the
Phœnician wished to train the youth into roving habits, and
to root out early that affection for home and parents that
would injure the quality of the sailor. The child was not
trained to reverence parents and home. His religious
worship, too, was peculiar. He celebrated the pain of
his gods. Melkarth was worshiped as a hero who had
gone through great and useful labors like Hercules and
become a god. Indeed Hercules is just the Greek copy
of Melkarth, and was doubtless borrowed from the Phœnicians.
The worship of Adonis by a sort of funeral commemoration
of his death—loud lamentations and sad ceremonies—prevailed
here also. We must note again that this
worship of pain in Phœnicia, as well as the reverence for
death in Egypt betokens a deeper insight into the mysteries
of the relation of the human nature to the divine nature
than we could find existing among the Persians or the Hindoos.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians obtained and held a “quarter” set apart
for their trading colony in cities wherever they could gain
a footing. They introduced luxuries among rude peoples,
and found their profit in catering for them. They united
producer and consumer, and used deceit and cunning, and
(whenever necessary or useful) violence, but always for the
promotion of trade.</p>

<p>They carried their forms of religious worship with their
wares, and must have met with considerable success in introducing
it among the Celtic peoples in Western Europe,
if the Druid religion was a Phœnician importation among
them, as seems likely.</p>

<p>The Phœnician concealed his discoveries under mythical
narrations calculated to frighten away the sailors of other
peoples from the places he had discovered. The fearful
worship of the fire-god Moloch, to whom they sacrificed
especially children, laying them in his red-hot arms while
the mothers standing by were not allowed to express their
pain at the spectacle by cries, seems to have been a powerful
means of educating by religious ceremonial the parental
and filial indifference necessary for the training of this people
of commercial adventurers.</p>

<p>The Oriental and African education thus far considered
does not seem to have had much respect for the individual
man as such.</p>

<p>Of all Asiatics the Hebrews are the most interesting to
the modern world. These as Jehovah’s chosen people will
hold the place of honor throughout all time. They are preëminently
the educated people, because educated by Jehovah;
and preëminently the educators, because it is through
them that the world has been taught the personality of God.</p>

<p><i>Judea.</i>—Out from among a Chaldean people, of Sabæan
religion, worshipers of the heavenly bodies, went Abraham,
and founded a people that should reveal the true God to all
nations.</p>

<p>At first there was a nomadic or herdsman’s life of his
people; then the Egyptian bondage, a training in the highest
civilization of that time. The chosen people were to
learn agriculture and the arts, and leave off the herdsman’s
life. Then in the promised land comes the development of
the city life under the kings. The patriarchal, the agricultural,
and the urban phases of life make up the national
forms. Then there is the captivity to Babylon in which
takes place another phase of the education of this people.
Finally, under the Roman dominion, there is born the Desire
of all Nations in Bethlehem, and the career of the Hebrews
as a chosen people is at an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jew educated his children with the utmost tenderness
and care, for they were the gift of Jehovah, and should
be consecrated to him by education in his law and in the
teachings of the prophets.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive of any other education of so
powerful a character or of so spiritual and ennobling a tendency
as the education of the Jewish child in the history of
the dealings of Jehovah with his forefathers. His national
history revealed the direct relation of man to God.</p>

<p>God is a teacher. He reveals his will to men. The consciousness
of being God’s people educated those colossal individualities
the patriarchs, the great national leaders, and
the prophets. Their biographies furnish types of character
that have a pedagogical value for all time.</p>

<p>With his idea of God as a father, the Jew becomes the
most humane of all peoples. His respect for bodily life, his
humanity toward widows and orphans, his institution of
the Jubilee year, the scape-goat, the laws against cruelty to
animals, have been a great lesson to modern civilization.</p>

<p>The Psalms of David that celebrate God’s greatness, goodness,
providence, patient kindness and forgiveness, present
for all time the expression of what is most comforting and
most purifying to the human soul.</p>

<p>The Egyptian and Phœnician spirit is limited by nature.
The Jewish is elevated above it. He conceives God as pure
causality;—the creator of the world;—the sun and stars are
not his special revelation and in no respect to be reverenced
by man.</p>

<p>Man is greater than nature because he is chosen by the
Almighty as his friend, and unconscious nature is not worthy
such a destiny. Righteousness is honor of God, and
mere ceremony is not. Mere nature is not adequate to the
revelation of the divine. It is not the hurricane nor the
earthquake that reveals God, but the small voice that speaks
to man’s spirit and reason. The human heart is the place
for God, but the sun and moon are not his incarnations.</p>

<p>Finally the Jew conceives of the unity of humanity in
one people, who shall all worship the One Personal God.
Nationality, talent, caste, work, accidents of any sort are
all indifferent compared with knowledge of the true God
and subjection to his will. The God of the Jewish people
is not a special, national God over against the gods of other
nations. He is the One only God and all others are false
gods, mere wood and stone, mere things. Thus for the Jew
there is the doctrine that all people descend from Adam
created by Jehovah. The Prince of Peace shall come to
heal the nations, and his character shall be holiness—not
physical strength, or beauty, or great size, or dignity of
bearing, but holiness and humility and patience. He shall
take upon himself infirmities and disgrace in order to redeem
the world. He will be the Messiah.</p>

<p>Here is the greatest educational idea ever conceived in
this world!</p>

<h3>MACBETH.</h3>

<p>When Duncan the Meek reigned King of Scotland, there
lived a great thane, or lord, called Macbeth. This Macbeth
was a near kinsman to the king, and in great esteem at
court for his valor and conduct in the wars; an example of
which he had lately given, in defeating a rebel army, assisted
by the troops of Norway, in terrible numbers.</p>

<p>The two Scottish generals, Macbeth and Banquo, returning
victorious from this great battle, their way lay over a
blasted heath, where they were stopped by the strange appearance
of three figures, like women, except that they had
beards, and their withered skins and wild attire made them
look not like any earthly creatures. Macbeth first addressed
them, when they, seemingly offended, laid each one her
choppy finger upon her skinny lips, in token of silence: and
the first of them saluted Macbeth with the title of “Thane
of Glamis.” The general was not a little startled to find
himself known by such creatures, but how much more,
when the second of them followed up that salute by giving
him the title of “Thane of Cawdor,” to which honor he
had no pretensions! and again the third bid him, “All
hail! <i>king that shalt be hereafter!</i>” Such prophetic greeting
might well amaze him, who knew that while the king’s
sons lived he could not hope to succeed to the throne. Then
turning to Banquo, they pronounced him, in a sort of riddling
terms, to be <i>lesser than Macbeth and greater! not so
happy, but much happier!</i> and prophesied that though he
should never reign, yet his sons after him should be kings
in Scotland. They then turned into air, and vanished: by
which the generals knew them to be the weird sisters, or
witches.</p>

<p>While they stood pondering upon the strangeness of this
adventure, there arrived certain messengers from the king,
who were empowered by him to confer upon Macbeth the
dignity of Thane of Cawdor. An event so miraculously
corresponding with the prediction of the witches astonished
Macbeth, and he stood rapt in amazement, unable to
make reply to the messengers; and in that point of time
swelling hopes arose in his mind, that the prediction of the
third witch might in like manner have its accomplishment,
and that he should one day reign in Scotland. Turning to
Banquo, he said, “Do you not hope that your children shall
be kings, when what the witches promised to me has so
wonderfully come to pass?” “That hope,” answered the
general, “might enkindle you to aim at the throne: but oftentimes
these ministers of darkness tell us truths in little
things, to betray us into deeds of greatest consequence.”
But the wicked suggestions of the witches had sunk too
deep into the mind of Macbeth, to allow him to attend to
the warnings of the good Banquo. From that time he bent
all his thoughts how to compass the crown of Scotland.</p>

<p>Macbeth had a wife, to whom he communicated the
strange prediction of the weird sisters, and its partial accomplishment.
She was a bad, ambitious woman, and so
as her husband and herself could arrive at greatness, she
cared not much by what means. She spurred on the reluctant
purposes of Macbeth, who felt compunction at the
thoughts of blood, and did not cease to represent the murder
of the king as a step absolutely necessary to the fulfilment
of the flattering prophecy.</p>

<p>It happened at this time that the king, who, out of his
royal condescension, would oftentimes visit his principal
nobility on gracious terms, came to Macbeth’s house, attended
by his two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, and a
numerous train of thanes and attendants, the more to honor
Macbeth for the triumphal success of his wars. The castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of Macbeth was pleasantly situated, and the air about it was
sweet and wholesome, which appeared by the nests which
the martlet, or swallow, had built under all the jutting
friezes and buttresses of the building, wherever it found a
place of advantage: for where those birds most breed and
haunt, the air is observed to be delicate. The king entered,
well pleased with the place, and not less so with the attentions
and respect of his honored hostess, lady Macbeth, who
had the art of covering treacherous purposes with smiles;
and could look like the innocent flower, while she was indeed
the serpent under it. The king, being tired with his
journey, went early to bed, and in his state-room two
grooms of his chamber (as was the custom) slept beside him.
He had been unusually pleased with his reception, and had
made presents, before he retired, to his principal officers;
and among the rest, had sent a rich diamond to Lady Macbeth,
greeting her by the name of his most kind hostess.</p>

<p>Now was the middle of the night, when over half the
world nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse men’s
minds asleep, and none but the wolf and the murderer is
abroad. This was the time when Lady Macbeth waked to
plot the murder of the king. She would not have undertaken
a deed so abhorrent to her sex, but that she feared her
husband’s nature, that it was too full of the milk of human
kindness, to do a contrived murder. She knew him to be
ambitious, but withal to be scrupulous, and not yet prepared
for that height of crime which commonly in the end accompanies
inordinate ambition. She had won him to consent
to the murder, but she doubted his resolution: and she
feared that the natural tenderness of his disposition (more
humane than her own) would come between and defeat the
purpose. So with her own hands armed with a dagger, she
approached the king’s bed; having taken care to ply the
grooms of his chamber so with wine, that they slept intoxicated,
and careless of their charge. There lay Duncan, in a
sound sleep after the fatigues of his journey, and as she
viewed him earnestly, there was something in his face, as
he slept, which resembled her own father; and she had not
the courage to proceed.</p>

<p>She returned to confer with her husband. His resolution
had begun to stagger. He considered that there were strong
reasons against the deed. In the first place, he was not only
a subject, but a near kinsman to the king; and he had been
his host and entertainer that day, whose duty by the laws
of hospitality it was to shut the door against his murderers,
not bear the knife himself. Then he considered how just
and merciful a king this Duncan had been, how clear of
offense to his subjects, how loving to his nobility, and in
particular to him; that such kings are the peculiar care of
Heaven, and their subjects doubly bound to revenge their
deaths. Besides, by the favors of the king, Macbeth stood
high in the opinion of all sorts of men, and how would
those honors be stained by the reputation of so foul a murder!</p>

<p>In these conflicts of the mind Lady Macbeth found her
husband, inclining to the better part, and resolving to proceed
no further. But she being a woman not easily shaken
from her evil purpose, began to pour in at his ears words
which infused a portion of her own spirit into his mind, assigning
reason upon reason why he should not shrink from
what he had undertaken; how easy the deed was; how
soon it would be over; and how the action of one short
night would give to all their nights and days to come sovereign
sway and royalty! Then she threw contempt on his
change of purpose, and accused him of fickleness and cowardice;
and declared that she had given suck, and knew
how tender it was to love the babe that milked her, but she
would while it was smiling in her face, have plucked it from
her breast, and dashed its brains out, if she had so sworn to
do it, as he had sworn to perform that murder. Then she
added, how practicable it was to lay the guilt of the deed
upon the drunken, sleepy grooms. And with the valor of
her tongue she so chastised his sluggish resolutions, that he
once more summoned up courage to the bloody business.</p>

<p>So, taking the dagger in his hand, he softly stole in the
dark to the room where Duncan lay; and as he went, he
thought he saw another dagger in the air, with the handle
toward him, and on the blade and at the point of it drops of
blood. But when he tried to grasp at it, it was nothing but
air, a mere phantasm proceeding from his own hot and oppressed
brain and the business he had in hand. Getting rid
of this fear, he entered the king’s room, whom he despatched
with one stroke of his dagger. Just as he had done the
murder, one of the grooms who slept in the chamber, laughed
in his sleep, and the other cried, “Murder,” which woke
them both: but they said a short prayer; one of them said,
“God bless us!” and the other answered, “Amen,” and addressed
themselves to sleep again. Macbeth, who stood
listening to them, tried to say “Amen” when the fellow
said “God bless us!” but, though he had most need of a
blessing, the word stuck in his throat, and he could not pronounce
it. Again he thought he heard a voice which cried,
“Sleep no more: Macbeth doth murder sleep, the innocent
sleep, that nourishes life.” Still it cried, “Sleep no more,”
to all the house. “Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore
Cawdor shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no
more.”</p>

<p>With such horrible imaginations, Macbeth returned to his
listening wife, who began to think he had failed of his purpose,
and that the deed was somehow frustrated. He came
in so distracted a state, that she reproached him with his
want of firmness, and sent him to wash his hands of the
blood which stained them, while she took his dagger, with
purpose to stain the cheeks of the grooms with blood, to
make it seem their guilt.</p>

<p>Morning came, and with it the discovery of the murder,
which could not be concealed; and though Macbeth and his
lady made great show of grief, and the proofs against the
grooms (the dagger being produced against them and their
faces smeared with blood) were sufficiently strong, yet the
entire suspicion fell upon Macbeth, whose inducements to
such a deed were so much more forcible than poor silly
grooms could be supposed to have, and Duncan’s two sons
fled. Malcolm, the eldest, sought for refuge in the English
court; and the youngest, Donalbain, made his escape to Ireland.</p>

<p>The king’s sons, who should have succeeded him, having
thus vacated the throne, Macbeth as next heir was crowned
king, and thus the prediction of the weird sisters was literally
accomplished.</p>

<p>Though placed so high, Macbeth and his queen could not
forget the prophecy of the weird sisters, that, though Macbeth
should be king, yet not his children, but the children
of Banquo, should be kings after him. The thought of this,
and that they had defiled their hands with blood, and done
so great crimes, only to place the posterity of Banquo upon
the throne, so rankled within them, that they determined
to put to death both Banquo and his son, to make void the
predictions of the weird sisters, which in their own case had
been so remarkably brought to pass. For this purpose they
made a great supper, to which they invited all the chief
thanes; and among the rest, with marks of particular respect,
Banquo and his son Fleance were invited. The way
by which Banquo was to pass to the palace at night, was beset
by murderers appointed by Macbeth, who stabbed Banquo;
but in the scuffle Fleance escaped. From that Fleance
descended a race of monarchs who afterwards filled the
Scottish throne, ending with James the Sixth of Scotland
and the First of England, under whom the two crowns of
England and Scotland were united.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>At supper the queen, whose manners were in the highest
degree affable and royal, played the hostess with a gracefulness
and attention which conciliated every one present, and
Macbeth discoursed freely with his thanes and nobles,
saying, that all that was honorable in the country was under
his roof, if he had but his good friend Banquo present, whom
yet he hoped he should rather have to chide for neglect,
than to lament for any mischance. Just at these words the
ghost of Banquo, whom he had caused to be murdered, entered
the room, and placed himself on the chair which
Macbeth was about to occupy. Though Macbeth was a bold
man, at this horrible sight his cheeks turned white with
fear and he stood quite unmanned with his eyes fixed upon
the ghost. His queen and all the nobles, who saw nothing,
but perceived him gazing (as they thought) upon an empty
chair, took it for a fit of distraction; and she reproached
him, whispering that it was but the same fancy which had
made him see the dagger in the air when he was about to
kill Duncan. But Macbeth continued to see the ghost, and
gave no heed to all they could say, while he addressed it
with distracted words, yet so significant, that his queen
fearing the dreadful secret would be disclosed, in great haste
dismissed the guests, excusing the infirmity of Macbeth as
a disorder he was often troubled with.</p>

<p>To such dreadful fancies Macbeth was subject. His queen
and he had their sleeps afflicted with terrible dreams, and
the blood of Banquo troubled them not more than the
escape of Fleance, whom they now looked upon as father
to a line of kings, who should keep their posterity out of
the throne. With these miserable thoughts they found no
peace, and Macbeth determined once more to seek out the
weird sisters, and know from them the worst.</p>

<p>He sought them in a cave upon the heath, where they,
who knew by foresight of his coming, were engaged in preparing
their dreadful charms, by which they conjured up
infernal spirits to reveal to them futurity. Their horrid ingredients
were toads, bats, and serpents, the eye of a newt,
and tongue of a dog, the leg of a lizard, and the wing of the
night-owl, the scale of a dragon, the tooth of a wolf, the
maw of the ravenous salt-sea shark, the mummy of a witch,
the root of the poisonous hemlock (this to have effect must
be digged in the dark), the gall of a goat, and the liver of a
Jew, with slips of the yew tree that roots itself in graves,
and the finger of a dead child: all these were set on to boil
in a great kettle, or cauldron, which, as fast as it grew too
hot, was cooled with a baboon’s blood: to these they poured
in the blood of a sow that had eaten her young, and they
threw into the flame the grease that had sweaten from a
murderer’s gibbet. By these charms they bound the infernal
spirits to answer their questions.</p>

<p>It was demanded of Macbeth, whether he would have his
doubts resolved by them, or by their masters, the spirits.
He, nothing daunted by their dreadful ceremonies which he
saw, boldly answered, “Where are they? let me see them.”
And they called the spirits, which were three. And the
first arose in the likeness of an armed head, and he called
Macbeth by name, and bid him beware of the thane of Fife;
for which caution Macbeth thanked him: for Macbeth had
entertained a jealousy of Macduff, the thane of Fife. And
the second spirit arose in the likeness of a bloody child, and
he called Macbeth by name, and bid him have no fear, but
laugh to scorn the power of man, for none of woman born
should have power to hurt him: and he advised him to be
bloody, bold, and resolute. “Then live, Macduff!” cried
the king; “what need I fear of thee? but yet I will make
assurance doubly sure. Thou shalt not live; that I may tell
pale-hearted fear it lies, and sleep in spite of thunder.”
That spirit being dismissed, a third arose in the form of a
child crowned, with a tree in his hand. He called Macbeth
by name, and comforted him against conspiracies, saying,
that he should never be vanquished, until the wood of
Birnam to Dunsinane-Hill should come against him.
“Sweet bodements! good?” cried Macbeth; “who can unfix
the forest, and move it from its earth-bound roots? I see I
shall live the usual period of man’s life, and not be cut off
by a violent death. But my heart throbs to know one
thing. Tell me, if your art can tell so much, if Banquo’s
issue shall ever reign in this kingdom?” Here the cauldron
sunk into the ground, and a noise of music was heard, and
eight shadows, like kings, passed by Macbeth, and Banquo
last, who bore a glass which showed the figures of many
more, and Banquo, all bloody, smiled upon Macbeth, and
pointed to them; by which Macbeth knew that these were
the posterity of Banquo, who should reign after him in
Scotland; and the witches, with a sound of soft music, and
with dancing, making a show of duty and welcome to
Macbeth, vanished. And from this time the thoughts of
Macbeth were all bloody, and dreadful.</p>

<p>The first thing he heard when he got out of the witches’
cave, was, that Macduff, thane of Fife, had fled to England,
to join the army which was forming against him under Malcolm,
the eldest son of the late king, with intent to displace
Macbeth, and set Malcolm, the right heir, upon the throne.
Macbeth, stung with rage, set upon the castle of Macduff,
and put his wife and children, whom the thane had left behind,
to the sword, and extended the slaughter to all who
claimed the least relationship to Macduff.</p>

<p>These and such-like deeds alienated the minds of all his
chief nobility from him. Such as could, fled to join with
Malcolm and Macduff, who were now approaching with a
powerful army which they had raised in England; and the
rest secretly wished success to their arms, though for fear
of Macbeth they could take no active part. His recruits
went on slowly. Everybody hated the tyrant, nobody loved
or honored him, but all suspected him, and he began to
envy the condition of Duncan, whom he had murdered,
who slept soundly in his grave, against whom treason had
done its worst: neither steel nor poison, domestic malice
nor foreign levies, could hurt him any longer.</p>

<p>While these things were acting, the queen who had been
the sole partner in his wickedness, in whose bosom he could
sometimes seek a momentary repose from those terrible
dreams which afflicted them both nightly, died, it is supposed
by her own hands, unable to bear the remorse of guilt
and public hate; by which event he was left alone, without
a soul to love or care for him, or a friend to whom he could
confide his wicked purposes.</p>

<p>He grew careless of life, and wished for death; but the
near approach of Malcolm’s army roused in him what remained
of his ancient courage, and he determined to die (as
he expressed it) “with armor on his back.” Besides this,
the hollow promises of the witches had filled him with false
confidence, and he remembered the sayings of the spirits,
that none of woman born was to hurt him, and that he was
never to be vanquished till Birnam wood should come to
Dunsinane, which he thought could never be. So he shut
himself up in his castle, whose impregnable strength was
such as defied a siege: here he sullenly awaited the approach
of Malcolm. When, upon a day, there came a messenger
to him, pale and shaking with fear, almost unable to report
that which he had seen: for he averred, that as he stood
upon his watch on the hill, he looked towards Birnam, and
to his thinking the wood began to move! “Liar and slave,”
cried Macbeth; “if thou speakest false, thou shalt hang
alive upon the next tree, till famine end thee. If thy tale
be true, I care not if thou dost as much by me;” for Macbeth
now began to faint in resolution, and to doubt the
equivocal speeches of the spirits. He was not to fear till
Birnam wood should come to Dunsinane: and now a wood
did move! “However,” said he, “if this which he avouches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
be true, let us arm and out. There is no flying hence, nor
staying here. I begin to be weary of the sun, and wish my
life at an end.” With these desperate speeches he sallied
forth upon the besiegers, who had now come up to the
castle.</p>

<p>The strange appearance, which had given the messenger
an idea of a wood moving, is easily solved. When the besieging
army marched through the wood of Birnam, Malcolm,
like a skillful general, instructed his soldiers to hew
down every one a bough and bear it before him, by way of
concealing the true numbers of his host. This marching of
the soldiers with boughs had at a distance the appearance
which had frightened the messenger. Thus were the words
of the spirit brought to pass, in a sense different from that
in which Macbeth had understood them, and one great hold
of his confidence was gone.</p>

<p>And now a severe skirmishing took place, in which Macbeth,
though feebly supported by those who called themselves
his friends, but in reality hated the tyrant and inclined
to the party of Malcolm and Macduff, yet fought
with the extreme of rage and valor, cutting to pieces all who
were opposed to him, till he came to where Macduff was
fighting. Seeing Macduff, and remembering the caution of
the spirit who had counseled him to avoid Macduff above
all men, he would have turned, but Macduff, who had been
seeking him through the whole fight, opposed his turning,
and a fierce contest ensued; Macduff giving him many foul
reproaches for the murder of his wife and children. Macbeth,
whose soul was charged enough with blood of that
family already, would still have declined the combat; but
Macduff still urged him to it, calling him tyrant, murderer,
hell-hound, and villain.</p>

<p>Then Macbeth remembered the words of the spirit, how
none of woman born should hurt him; and smiling confidently
he said to Macduff: “Thou losest thy labor, Macduff.
As easily thou mayest impress the air with thy
sword as make me vulnerable. I bear a charmed life, which
must not yield to one of woman born.” “Despair thy
charm,” said Macduff, “and let that lying spirit whom thou
hast served, tell thee, that Macduff was never born of woman,
never as the ordinary manner of men is to be born,
but was untimely taken from his mother.” “Accursed be
the tongue which tells me so,” said the trembling Macbeth,
who felt his last hold of confidence give way; “and let never
man in future believe the lying equivocations of witches
and juggling spirits, who deceive us in words which have
double senses, and while they keep their promise literally,
disappoint our hopes with a different meaning. I will not
fight with thee.”</p>

<p>“Then live!” said the scornful Macduff; “we will have a
show of thee, as men show monsters, and a painted board,
on which shall be written, ‘Here men may see the tyrant!’”
“Never,” said Macbeth, whose courage returned with despair;
“I will not live to kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s
feet, and to be baited with the curses of the rabble.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, and thou opposed
to me who wast never born of woman, yet I will try
the last.” With these frantic words he threw himself upon
Macduff, who after a severe struggle in the end overcame
him, and cutting off his head, made a present of it to the
young and lawful king, Malcolm; who took upon him the
government which by the machinations of the usurper he
had so long been deprived of, and ascended the throne of
Duncan the Meek, amid the acclamation of the nobles and
the people.</p>

<p>This eminent lady is the daughter of the Archbishop of
Dublin, and one of the most distinguished philanthropists
in England. In the following pages will be found some
timely thoughts she has uttered in a lecture on</p>


<h3>SOCIAL DUTIES IN THE FAMILY.</h3>

<p>A mother’s love ought to be attuned to the very note of
the love divine,—to be, in fact, its echo from the deep cave
of her heart.</p>

<p>But, with super-earthly love to light her way what does
she see before her? There is, first, the duty of conducing to
her child’s moral welfare, the highest of all her duties; secondly,
of securing his bodily health; thirdly, of giving him
that intellectual training which will enlarge his being and
make his moral nature itself more robust and capable of
fulfilling his duties in life; and lastly, of making him as
happy as she may. These are each and all most complicated
problems to many a good mother, working perhaps against
wind and tide, with feeble health or limited means, or possibly
with a husband who thwarts and opposes her endeavors.
It would require not half a lecture, but a whole treatise,
to deal with such a subject fitly, even if I possessed the
experience or insight needful for the task. There is only
one point on which I think ethical science may be of some
utility. That point is the problem of <i>obedience</i>. How far
ought it to be enforced?</p>

<p>Three things are commonly confounded in speaking of
filial obedience—</p>

<p>First—The obedience which must be exacted from a child
for its own physical, intellectual, and moral welfare.</p>

<p>Second—The obedience which the parent may exact for
his (the parent’s) welfare or convenience.</p>

<p>Third—The obedience which parent and child alike owe
to the moral law, and which it is the parent’s duty to teach
the child to pay.</p>

<p>If mothers would but keep these three kinds of obedience
clear and distinct in their minds, I think much of the supposed
difficulty of the problem would disappear. And, if
children as they grow up would likewise discriminate between
them, many of their troubles would be relieved.</p>

<p>For the first, the excellent old Dr. Thomas Brown lays
down (Lectures on Ethics, p. 287) a principle which seems
to me exactly to fit the case. He says that parents “should
impose no restraint which has not for its object some good
greater than the temporary evil of the restraint itself.” For
an infant, the restraint is no evil; and at that age everything
must be a matter of obedience, the babe possessing no
sense or experience for self-guidance. But, as childhood
advances, so should freedom advance; and, even if the little
boy or girl does now and then learn by sharp experience,
the lesson will generally be well worth the cost: whereas
the evils of over-restraint have no compensation. Each
one is bad in itself, checking the proper development of
character, chilling the spirits, and also in a cumulative way
becoming increasingly mischievous, as the miserable sense
of being fettered becomes confirmed.</p>

<p>In all this matter of the child’s own welfare, the mother’s
aim ought to be to become the life-long counselor of her
child; and a counselor is (by the very hypothesis) one who
does not persist in claiming authority. Nobody thinks of
<i>consulting</i> another who may conclude their “advice” by
saying, “And now I <i>order</i> you to do as I have advised.”
To drop, as completely and as early as possible, the tone of
command, and assume that of the loving, sympathetic,
ever disinterested guide and friend,—that is, I think, the
true wisdom of every mother, as it was that of my own. Of
course, there are cases so grave (especially where girls who
little understand the need of caution are concerned) that it
is absolutely necessary, nay, the mother’s pressing duty, to
prohibit her daughter from running into danger. To apply
Brown’s rule, the evil of the restraint is more than counter-balanced
by immunity from deadly peril. Perhaps it is one
of the principal causes of the dissatisfaction of young girls
with parental control that they do not and can not understand
what horrible dangers may overtake them in the still
foul condition of society.</p>

<p>Second—It is too little remembered that a parent has a
moral right to exact obedience as a form of <i>service</i> from his
child. The parent has, in strictest ethical sense, the first of
all claims on the child’s <i>special benevolence</i>; <i>i. e.</i>, on his <i>will
to do good</i>. The double ties of gratitude and of closest human
relationship make it the duty of the child to pay that
sacred debt from first to last; and it is entirely fit and
greatly for its benefit that the parent should claim that duty.
The parent’s <i>direction</i> in such cases, properly translated, is
not a <i>command</i>, to which the response is blind obedience,
but an indication of the way in which the person to whom
the debt is due desires that it should be paid. There ought
to be nothing in the slightest degree harsh or dictatorial in
such direction. On the contrary, I can not but think that
the introduction by parents of much greater courtesy to
their children would be an immense advantage in this and
other cases. We all ask our servants politely to do for us
the services which they have contracted to do, and for which
we pay them. How much more kindly and courteously
ought we to ask of our children to perform services due by
the blessed and holy debt of nature and gratitude, and
which ought, each one, to be a joy to the child as well as to
the parent! When it is rightly demanded and cheerfully
paid, how excellent and beautiful to both is this kind of
filial duty! When, for example, we see little girls of the
working classes taught to carry their father’s dinner to the
field as soon as they can toddle, and helping their mother
to “mind the baby,” even if it be a “little Moloch” of a
baby, we witness both the fulfillment of a legitimate claim
on the part of the parents, and a most beneficent moral
training for the child. I think this sort of service of the
child is sadly lacking among the richer classes, and that it
would be an excellent thing if mothers, however wealthy,
found means of making their children more useful to themselves.
Nothing can be worse for a child than to find everything
done for her, and never to be called upon to do anything
for anybody else. Indeed, any fine-natured child,
like a dog, will find much more real pleasure in being of
use, or fancying it is so, than in being perpetually pampered
and amused. Of course there would be moral limits
to such claims on the parent’s part, as, <i>e. g.</i>, when they
would interfere with the child’s health or education. But
there is no natural termination in point of age to the parent’s
right to give such directions for his own service. On the
contrary, the time when the adult son or daughter has come
into the full possession of his or her faculties, while the
parent is sinking into the infirmities of age, is the very
time when filial duty is most imperative in its obligation;
and the fact that aged parents rarely attempt to give to
adult sons and daughters the same directions for their
comfort as they gave them when children shows how little
the real nature of these sacred rights and duties is commonly
understood.</p>

<p>Third—There is the <i>obedience</i> which both parent and
child owe to the eternal moral law; and this obedience
again ought to be kept perfectly distinct from that which is
exacted either for the child’s personal welfare or the parent’s
convenience. The old and most important distinction between
a thing which is <i>malum in se</i> and a thing which is
only <i>malum prohibitum</i> ought never to be lost sight of.
Even in a very little child, I think, a moral fault, such as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
lie, or cruelty to an animal, or vindictiveness toward its
companions, ought to be treated with gravity and sadness;
and, as the child grows, an importance ought to be attached
to such faults wholly incommensurate with any other sort
of error, such as indolence about lessons or the like. The
one aim of the parent must be to make profound impression
of the awfulness and solemnity of moral good and moral evil.</p>

<p>But even here the difficulty haunts us, when is this enforcement
of obedience to moral laws to cease? So long as a
child is absolutely compelled to do right by sheer force and
terror of punishment, its moral freedom can have no scope,
and its moral life consequently can not even begin. It
can not acquire the <i>virtue</i> which results from free choice.
All that the parent can do (and it is an indispensable preparation
for virtue, though not virtue itself) is first to teach
the child what is right,—to draw out its latent moral sense,
and inspire it with the wish to do right,—and then to help its
steps in the path which has been pointed out. Once a
child grasps the idea of duty, and begins in its little way to
try to “be good,” and displays the indescribably touching
phenomena of childlike penitence and restoration, it becomes
surely the most sacred task for the mother to aid
such efforts—silently, indeed, for the most part, and too
reverentially to talk much about it—with tenderest sympathy.
It would be no kindness, of course, but cruelty, to
open up hastily ways of liberty before moral strength has
been gained to walk in them. The “hedging up the way
with thorns” is a divine precaution, which a mother may
well imitate. But the principle must be, as in the case of
directions in matters not moral, gradually and systematically
to exchange directions and orders for counsels and exhortations.</p>

<p>And here, in closing these, perhaps, too tedious remarks
on the moral training of children, I shall add a word which
may possibly startle some who hear me,—Beware that, in
earnestly seeking your child’s moral welfare, you do not
<i>force</i> the moral nature with hot-house culture. To be a
sturdy plant, it must grow naturally, and not too rapidly.
It seems as if it were not intended by Providence that this
supreme part of our human nature should be developed far
in childhood and early youth, lovely as are the blossoms it
sometimes then bears,—too often to drop into an untimely
grave, or wither away in the heat of manhood without
fruit. Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, undoubtedly made a great
mistake in this matter, as one of his very best disciples,
Arthur Hugh Clough, was able in later years to see. Mothers
should not be unhappy, if boys are honorable and kindly
and affectionate, if they should, at fifteen, prefer a game of
football to a visit of charity; and I should not blame at all
severely any of my young friends, if such there be here
present, who may be at this moment wishing that she were
playing lawn-tennis, instead of sitting still to hear a dull
dissertation on moral philosophy!</p>

<p>But, when all is done that can be done by human wisdom
to help the moral growth of the young, there is a vast space
left for the other and easier parental duty of <i>providing for
their happiness</i>. Of course, to nine parents out of ten, high
and low, it is the joy and delight of their lives to make
their children as happy as possible. There is no virtue in
this. Nature (or, let us say frankly, God) has so made us
that in middle life nearly all direct pleasures to be enjoyed
on our own account begin to pall. We are too busy or too
indifferent to care much for a score of things which, when
we were younger, we found quite entrancing.</p>

<p class='center'>
“It is the one great grief of life to feel all feelings die.”<br />
</p>

<p>But, just as our sun goes down to the horizon, a moonlight
reflection of pleasure, purer, calmer than the first,
rises to give a sweet interest to the lives of all who are
happy enough to have young creatures around them. The
pleasures we can no longer taste for ourselves we taste in
our children’s enjoyment. Their glee, their eagerness,
their freshness of delight, stir our pulses with tenderness
and sympathy. I do not know anything in the world
which pulls one’s heartstrings so much as the sight of a
little blue-eyed, golden-haired, white-frocked atom of humanity
clapping its hands and crowing with ecstasy at the
sight of a kite soaring up into the summer sky.</p>

<p>Are we to ask parents to deny themselves and their children
in the stern old way, and turn their young lives into
dreary rounds of duty and work, till they hate the very
name of either one or the other? God forbid! Does God,
the great Parent, Father and Mother of the World, lead us
up to himself by any such harsh, stern tuition? Nay, but
has he not made earth so beautiful, and planted flowers by
every wayside, and gladdened our hearts by ten thousand
delights of the intellect, the senses, the tastes, and the affections?
Fear, my friends, to make your children <i>unhappy</i>,
and to love them <i>too little</i>. But never fear to make
them too happy or to love them too much! There is a
great, deep saying, that we must all enter the kingdom of
God as little children. Surely, the converse of it is true
also; and we should prepare in our homes a kingdom of
God,—of peace and love and tenderness and innocent pleasure,—whenever
a little child is sent to us out of heaven to
dwell in it.</p>

<p>We now come to speak of the duties of daughters. The
ethical grounds of the duty of supreme benevolence toward
our parents are clear. They are nearest to us of human beings.
We owe them life and (nearly always also) endless
cares and affection. In the case of a mother, her claims on
her child—founded on the bodily agony she has borne on its
behalf, and the ineffably sweet office of nursing (when she
has performed it), her care in infancy, and love and sympathy
in later years—make together such a cumulative title
to gratitude and devotion that it is impossible to place on it
any limitation.</p>

<p>This claim is, of course, happily usually admitted in the
case of daughters <i>who do not marry</i>. It is understood that
they are bound to do all they can for their mother’s and
father’s comfort. But, may I ask, who absolved the daughters
who marry from the same sacred obligation? In Catholic
countries, young women often quit their aged parents,
no matter how much they need them, to enter “religion,”
as it is said; and we Protestants are very indignant with
them for so doing. But, when it comes to our Protestant
religion of matrimony, lo! we are extremely indulgent to
the girl who deposits her filial obligations on what the
<i>Morning Post</i> calls the “Hymeneal Altar!” The daughter
practically says to her blind father or bed-ridden mother:
“Corban! I am going off to India with Captain Algernon,
who waltzes beautifully, and whom I met last night at a
ball. It is a gift by whatsoever you might have been profited
by me.”</p>

<p>Is this right or justifiable? Public opinion condones it;
and the parent often consents out of the abundance of unselfish
affection, thereby in a certain formal way releasing
the daughter from her natural debt. But I do not think, if
the parent really wants her services, that she can morally
withdraw them, even with such consent, and certainly not
<i>without</i> it.</p>

<p>We all see this remarkably clearly when the question is
not of marriage, but of a girl of the higher class devoting
herself to charity or art, or any kind of public work which
requires her to quit her parents’ roof. Then, indeed, even
if her parents be in the full vigor of life, and have half a
dozen other daughters, we are pretty sure to hear the solemn
condemnation of the adventurous damsel, “Angelina ought
to attend to her father and mother, and not go here or there
for this or that purpose.”</p>

<p>Surely there is a very obvious rule to cover all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
cases. If either parent <i>wants</i> the daughter she ought not to
leave him or her, <i>either</i> to marry or to go into a nunnery, or
for any other purpose. If her parents do <i>not</i> want her,
then, being of age to judge for herself, she is free <i>either</i> to
undertake the duties of a wife, or <i>any others</i> for which she
may feel a vocation.</p>

<p>This may sound very hard. It is undoubtedly the demand
for a very high degree of virtue, where the sacrifice may be
that of the happiness of a lifetime. But every duty may
sometimes claim such sacrifices. Parental duty does so
perpetually. How many thousands of mothers and fathers
toil all their days and give up health and every enjoyment
for their children’s interests! Why should not filial duties
likewise exact equal sacrifice? The entire devotion to the
parent when the parent really needs it, and the constant
devotion of as much care as the parent requires,—this, and
nothing short of this, seems to me to be the standard of
filial duty.</p>

<p>A very difficult question arises in the case of the abnormal
and scarcely sane development of selfishness which we
sometimes sadly witness in old age. I think, in such deplorable
cases, the child is called on to remember that, even
in her filial relation, the <i>moral welfare</i> of the object of benevolence
is before all other considerations, and that she is
bound to pause in a course which obviously is tending to
promote a great moral fault. Gently and with great care
and deference, she ought to remind the parent of the needs
of others.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in the lives of hundreds of daughters
of the upper ranks just now lies in this: that they find
themselves torn between two opposing impulses, and know
not which they ought to follow. On one side are the habits
of a child, and the assurance of everybody that the same
habits of quiescence and submission ought to be maintained
into womanhood. On the other hand there is the same
instinct which we see in a baby’s limbs, to stir, to change
its position, to climb, to run; to use, in short, the muscles
and faculties it possesses. Every young bird flutters away
from its nest, however soft; every little rabbit quits the
comfortable hole in which it was born; and we take it as fit
and right they should do so, even when there are hawks and
weasels all around. Only when a young girl wants to do
anything of the analogous kind, her instinct is treated as a
sort of sin. She is asked, “Can not she be contented, having
so nice a home and luxuries provided in abundance?”
Keble’s fine but much-misused lines, about “room to deny
ourselves” and the “common task” and “daily round” being
all we ought to require, are sure to be quoted against
her; and, in short, she feels herself a culprit, and probably
at least once a week has a fit of penitence for her incorrigible
“discontent.” I have known this kind of thing go on
for years, and it is repeated in hundreds, in thousands, of
families. I have known it where there were seven miserable,
big, young women in one little house! It is supposed
to be the most impossible thing in the world for a parent to
give his son a stone for bread or a serpent for a fish. But
scores of fathers, in the higher ranks, give their daughters
diamonds when they crave for education, and twist round
their necks the serpents of idle luxury and pleasure when
they ask for wholesome employment.</p>

<p>Pardon me if I speak very warmly on this subject, because
I think here lies one of the great evils of the condition of our
sex and class at this time; and I feel intensely for the
young spirits whose natural and whose <i>noble</i> aspirations are
so checked and deadened and quenched through all their
youth and years of energy that, when the time for emancipation
comes at last, it is too late for them to make use of
it. They have been dwarfed and stunted, and can never
either be or do anything greatly good.</p>

<p>In short, the complaint we women make against men,
that they persist in treating us as minors when we have attained
our majority, is what daughters too often can justly
make against both their fathers and mothers. They keep
them in the swaddling-clothes of childhood, when they
ought to set free and train every limb to its most athletic
and joyous exercise. Dangers, of course, on the other side
there are,—of over-emancipated and ill-advised girls who
sorely need more parental guidance than they obtain; but,
so far as my experience goes, these cases are few compared
to those of the young women (ladies, of course, I mean, for
in the lower classes such evils are unknown) whose lives
are spoiled by <i>over-restraint in innocent things</i>. They are
left free, and encouraged to plunge into the maelstrom of a
fashionable season’s senseless whirl of dissipation and luxury.
They are restrained from every effort at self-development
or rational self-sacrifice, till, for the very want of
some corrective bitter, they go and beat the hassocks in a
church as a pious exercise, or perhaps finally lock themselves
up in a nunnery. Small blame to them! Ritualist
nunneries at present offer the most easily accessible back-door
out of fine drawing-rooms into anything like a field of
usefulness.</p>

<p>Now for sisters. That brothers and sisters should give
one another in an ordinary way the first-fruits of their benevolence
follows obviously from the closeness of their
propinquity. Usually there has also been from childhood
the blessed interchange of kindnesses which accumulate on
both sides into a claim of reciprocal gratitude.</p>

<p>Miss Bremer remarks that “it is the general characteristic
of affection to make us blind to the faults of those we
love, but from this weakness <i>fraternal</i> love is wholly exempt.”
Brothers are indeed terrible critics of their sisters,
and, so far, irritating creatures. But otherwise, as we all
know, they are the very joy and pride of our lives; and
there is probably not one duty in our list which needs less
to be insisted on to women generally than that of bestowing
on their brothers not only love of benevolence, but also
a large amount of love of complacency. It is usually also
a truly sound moral sentiment, causing the sister to take
profound interest in the religious and moral welfare of her
brother, as well as in his health and happiness.</p>

<p>One mistake, I think, is often made by sisters, and still
more often by mothers, to which attention should be called.
The unselfishness of the sisters, and the fondness of the
mother for her boy, and the fact that the boy is but rarely
at home, all contribute to a habit of sacrificing everything
to the young lad’s pleasure or profit, which has the worst
effect on his character in after-life. Boys receive from
women themselves in the nursery, and when they come
home from school in the holidays, a regular <i>education in
selfishness</i>. They acquire the practice of looking on girls
and women as persons whose interests, education, and
pleasures must always, as a matter of course, be postponed
to their own. In later life, we rue—and their wives may
rue—the consequences.</p>

<p>The duties of sisters to sisters are even more close and
tender than those of sisters to brothers. I hardly know if
there be any salient fault in the usual behavior of English
sisters to one another which any moral system could set
right. Perhaps the one quality oftenest deficient in this,
and other more distant family relationships, to which we
need not further refer,—uncles, aunts, cousins, and so on—is
<i>courtesy</i>. “Too much familiarity,” as the proverb says,
“breeds contempt.” The habit of treating one another
without the little forms in use among other friends, and the
horrid trick of speaking rudely of each other’s defects or
mishaps, is the underlying source of half the alienation of
relatives. If we are bound to show <i>special benevolence</i> to
those nearest to us, why on earth do we give them pain at
every turn, rub them the wrong way, and <i>froisser</i> their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
natural <i>amour propre</i> by unflattering remarks or unkind
references? For once we can do them a real service of any
kind, we can (if we live with them) hurt, or else please,
them fifty times a day. The individual who thinks she performs
her duty to sister or niece, or cousin, while she waits
to do the exceptional services, and hourly frets and worries
and humiliates her, is certainly exceedingly mistaken.
Genuine benevolence—the “<i>will to make happy</i>”—will take
a very different course.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary here to pursue further the subject
of the duties arising from the ties of natural relationship,
holy and blessed things that they are! I am persuaded
that even the best and happiest of us only half-apprehend
their beautiful meaning, and that we must look to the life
beyond the grave to interpret for us all their significance.</p>

<p>Prof. Timayenis says that the author of the Chautauqua
Text-book on Greek History, and the author of the Preparatory
Greek Course in English, are mistaken in attributing
the remark, “Then we will fight them in the shade,” to
Leonidas. Prof. Timayenis says: “My authority is Herodotus,

Run through at that rate for twenty-five days, and show

Chautauqua games, which I hope he will see fit to publish.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. Cristy has adopted a very ingenious plan for a local
circle. He says: “I have prepared a narrative with breaks
to be filled in, in order, by the answers to the one hundred
questions in the October and November <span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span>.
One reads, and, as he comes to a break, suddenly calls for
some one to read the answer from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. If
the other does not find it, and begin before the reader counts
ten as the clock ticks, a forfeit is to be paid to the general
fund, thus insuring attention while the main points are reviewed
during the game.” A very bright way of spending

<hr class="short" />

<p>A lady from Vermont writes: “Since I wrote last, my
eldest brother, Dr. ——, of ——, and my own sister, Mrs.
——, have both joined the C. L. S. C. This makes four of
father’s family who belong to the ‘people’s college.’ With
the exception of the doctor we were all in the old home at
Christmas, and as my cousins were there too, we planned to
organize very quietly. We seated ourselves on the stairs
in the front hall, and were proceeding to business, when the
dear old mother announced that there was ‘a college being
organized in the house,’ so, of course, every one had to come
and look at us, and as each one said something wittier than
the last had said, we were soon in an uproar of merriment—a
very undignified college class. I think hereafter when
they read of the C. L. S. C., they will think of the company
of people on the stairs, and that is really what we are—going
up one step at a time. There are five in the circle, and we
have arranged to meet once in two weeks.” A good name,
<i>the On-the-Stairs circle</i>. Our correspondent in a later letter
adds: “Did I tell you that we sat near the foot of the stairs,
as symbolical of the heights we hope to climb? and on the
lowest step was a little girl who had left the company to be
near her mother, and in her we saw a type of the coming
generation, and the promise of an ever-widening circle. Do
urge it upon the mothers more and more to talk over their
studies with their little children. It not only helps mothers,
but it gives such zest to the studies of the little ones, when
they think that by-and-by they are going to study these
other wonderful things which now interest their parents.
Only this last week my little nine-year-old girl was having
a hard time over her geography lesson; out West seemed so
far away, but when I mentioned to her that Yellowstone
Park was out there it was like another lesson, or like another
girl studying—an interested girl.”</p>

<p>A cultivated lady writes: “One of the most agreeable
Methodist ladies in the city of New York recently asked of
me some information about the Chautauqua course. She
occupies a high social position in the church, and is possessed
of no little intelligence, but finds her time absorbed
in the cares of her domestic establishment. I gave her such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of the Chautauqua matter as I had at
hand, and asked how her interest in
the course had been awaked. She replied
that an amiable young kinswoman,
who is in the habit of visiting
her yearly, endeared herself to the
household, during her last visit, by the
development of her intelligence, the
animation of her conversation, and her
greatly improved intellectual character.
‘I found a Chautauqua text-book on
her dressing table,’ said my friend, ‘and
guessing the secret of the marked
change in her, asked her whether she
knew of the Chautauqua course?’ ‘Yes,
indeed!’ It had laid hold of her; she
could not do without it; such a blessing
and benefit it had been to her, etc.
Mrs. —, my friend, thereupon came to
the conclusion that she herself must
have the course. ‘My reading is necessarily
limited, but it need not be desultory,’
she said; ‘I want what we all
want—regulated reading.’ Accordingly
she has subscribed for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and begun the course. As she
has two little girls, and a boy fourteen
years old, the C. L. S. C. will not impart
its healthful influence and stimulus
to her alone. I am sure that it will
prove a well-spring, refreshing and
nourishing her household.”</p>

<p>The songs used by the C. L. S. C. at the Round Table, and in all their gatherings

them. Through the kindness of the Rev. Dr. Vincent we shall furnish our readers,
every month, with one or more of these songs set to music. Thus local
circles will have them furnished for use, in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and every

songs of the home.</p></div>

officers and members of local circles, bearing tidings of
organizations effected, and of work done. There is not

your report does not appear promptly you can afford to be

<p><b>Maine (Parks Island).</b>—We have a local branch of the C.
L. S. C. here on this little down-east island. We have but
fifteen members as yet, but hope to improve in numbers another
year. We did not commence work until November,
and have had quite hard work to catch up with the regular
course, but think we shall be able to accomplish it after
a little more hard work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Maine (Lewiston).</b>—We have three local circles in this
city. They were organized this C. L. S. C. year. Most of
the members began the course of reading last October. One
of the circles is designated as the “Universalist,” another
the “Methodist,” each of which has a membership of about
twenty-five. The third, which is called the “Alpha” C. L.
S. C., is much smaller, the number being limited to ten.
Five of these are members of the Class of 1885. The Alpha
class have been holding monthly meetings, but owing to the
increased interest have decided to meet once in two weeks.
Our gatherings have been very informal and pleasant at the
home of one of the members. The previous month’s work
is carefully reviewed, any topic not well understood is freely
discussed, it being the privilege of each member to ask any
question relative to the work. Essays are prepared and
listened to carefully. At our December meeting two essays
on “Geology” were presented—one embracing the October
reading on that subject, the other the November—thus
bringing into one lesson the principal features of Prof. Packard’s
“First Lessons” in that science. The class enjoyed
the evening very much and believe it will be a help to have
the main points of a single branch of study all brought out
in one evening’s work—that is as far as possible.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Vermont (Rutland).</b>—Last year we organized our circle
with five members, but only three finished the reading and
answered the questions. This year we have nine members,
and we meet the last Monday evening in the month. Each
member is given a few questions on the month’s reading to
answer. After meeting a few times we hope to be a little
more methodical in doing our work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Vermont (St. Albans).</b>—We have not organized a local circle
here, though there are not less than twenty persons
reading the course in this city.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (East Boston).</b>—In East Boston a local circle
was formed in October, meetings once a fortnight, and the
membership has increased from seven to twenty-two. There
is one graduate, one of the Class of ’84; the rest are beginners
in the C. L. S. C.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Gloucester).</b>—The first local circle of the C.
L. S. C. in Gloucester was organized October 23, 1882. We
have seventeen regular members. The committee of instruction
consists of the president, vice president and secretary.
We meet at different houses once a month, from 8
to 9:30 p. m. The first subject of the evening, January 15,
was “Geology.” The questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> on
this subject were first asked and answered, after which Miss
Helen Fiske, one of our High School teachers, gave an interesting
talk on the subject. Second in order came questions
on “Russian History,” prepared by a member, which
were followed by questions on “Scandinavian History.”
Then came an interesting and enthusiastic talk on the
“Greek Course in English,” the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
being used. We do feel very thankful for the
questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>—they are of great value
in the course of study. Our programs vary. We use the
questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> always, interspersed with
talks, prepared questions, etc. We find this year’s course
of study very entertaining and profitable. Though our circle
is at the foot of the ladder, we are ready to step upward.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Franklin).</b>—Our circle—known as the
Franklin Branch of the C. L. S. C.—was organized in November,
1882, and numbers twenty-three members—eight
gentlemen and fifteen ladies. Of this number one is the
pastor of the Congregational church, one a deacon of that
church, one the editor of the local newspaper, one a physician,
two are school teachers, one a wife of a Universalist
minister, one a dentist, and <i>all</i> earnest and interested students
of the C. L. S. C. We were favored on Thursday
evening, Feb. 1, with the presence of our dearly beloved Dr.
Vincent, who gave a public lecture under our auspices in
the chapel of the First Congregational church. Subject,
“That Boy.” After the lecture all the Chautauquans present
had the privilege of taking him by the hand, and then were
briefly addressed by him upon Chautauqua studies. Many of
our members are very busy with their daily occupations, and
find it difficult to keep up their course of study, but the
Doctor’s stirring and encouraging words have inspired them
to persevere, and we hope to be able to sit at the Round-Table
at our New England Chautauqua Grounds, South Framingham,
with our year’s course of study all completed, and
to enroll next year a much larger membership in our circle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Holbrook).</b>—This segment of the C. L. S.
C. is located at Holbrook, Norfolk Co., Massachusetts, a
town of some two thousand five hundred inhabitants, incorporated
in 1872. It is located fourteen miles south of
Boston, on the Old Colony Railroad, and is engaged principally
in the manufacture of boots and shoes, some eighty
thousand cases, valued at $2,500,000, being produced annually.
The circle, organized October 1, 1880, with a membership
of six, and pursued that year’s course, holding fortnightly
meetings for the discussion of the topics studied.
The next year three joined our number, and the meetings
were conducted after the first year’s method, excepting the
occasional reading of papers upon subjects assigned. The
closing meeting of this year (1882, July 3), anticipated the
exercises held nearly two months later at Chautauqua, “a
grove meeting,” a feast and camp-fire being the accompaniments.
1883 finds us increased in vigor, with a local membership
of fifteen (ten Chautauquans). Our meetings thus
far have been for the study of geology, George M. Smith, principal
of the high school, aiding us by giving illustrated talks
upon the subject. We have the promise of talks on “Greek
Life and Writers” by Rev. Ezekiel Russell, D. D. Our circle
fortunately has enlisted the interest and services of the
educated. Its government is simple, a president and secretary,
with a few rules for the conduct of business. All
are encouraged to unite in the prosecution of this system of
education.</p>

<p><b>Massachusetts (Rockbottom).</b>—The Hudson Circle meets
every other Monday evening. We number sixteen members,
and expect a few more. At every meeting the president
asks the questions from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. One or
two special papers on topics connected with the reading
are presented by members who were appointed for that purpose.
We have a critic who corrects any and all mistakes,
including the pronunciation of words. If there is any spare
time, it is used for social intercourse. Our last lecture was
given by the Rev. T. S. Bacons, on “Geological Formations
about the Hudson.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (West Haverhill).</b>—A local circle was formed
at West Haverhill, Mass., October 10, 1882. We meet
one evening each month. Our meetings are very interesting
and profitable. The exercises vary, with one
exception—we usually have the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
as we think they help to fix the reading we have
been over more firmly in our minds. We have eighteen
members, and we are just commencing our studies, so we
have not as interesting a story to tell as many others, but
we hope in our quiet way to be better men and women because
of the privileges we enjoy in the C. L. S. C.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Connecticut (Niantic).</b>—Our circle re-organized on October
2, 1882, beginning its second year. We meet every Monday
evening, at the house of each of the members in turn. The
circle is now as large as can conveniently meet in a private
parlor, so we have obtained permission from the church
authorities to meet in the Congregational church parlor.
There are now twenty-seven members, five of whom belong
to the national circle. This is an increase over last year,
for then our number was only twenty. The exercises
commence with the reading of the secretary’s report of the
previous meeting, and then a collection is taken to pay postage
and other expenses of the circle. After this the president
asks the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and the answers
are either recited or read. The reading is the last
thing before the motions are made and the voting and other
business of the circle done, and we adjourn. We read books
in the course which will interest the majority of the members.
It has generally been those upon which questions
and answers are prepared and published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
At the meetings we use a dictionary constantly,
for every difference in pronunciation is noticed, and the
word is looked up. We begin promptly at seven o’clock, and
close at nine.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Troy).</b>—The Rev. H. C. Farrar, president of a
local circle in Troy, an old Chautauquan and successful C.
L. S. C. worker, writes: In our city there are seven circles,
all organized this year, numbering in membership some
five hundred. Our circle numbers over two hundred members
and we have had the grace to call it the “Vincent Circle.”
Each circle is doing full and vigorous work, and
almost weekly new members are adding themselves. The
C. L. S. C. in very many ways is blessing our city. The
booksellers never sold so many books of real merit as during
the holidays just passed. One firm sold over a dozen
Webster’s dictionaries, and all of them were Christmas
presents to C. L. S. C.’s. In this vicinity about twenty
other circles have been formed since October. So goes the
good work bravely on. I can not forbear making an extract
from a letter of Rev. J. M. Appleman, Pownal, Vermont:
“Mrs. A. and myself commenced the course in October.
We availed ourselves of every favorable opportunity
to speak in the interest of the C. L. S. C. Many were favorably
impressed, but we could not persuade any to join
us. We then put the “Hall in the Grove” into the itinerant
work and it found favor everywhere, and so great was
the demand for it we put another copy on the circuit. I
have not seen either copy for several weeks. About the
first of December it fell into the hands of a prominent
young man and his enthusiasm went to white heat at once
and he said: ‘We must have a circle,’ and a circle we have
of eleven members and the tide is still rising.” Many of
our members have had a new world of thought and life
opened to them through geology and Greek history and
they are anticipating great things in astronomy. While
studying geology we made excursions into the country and
with hammer and bag practically geologized. We spent
two hours at the State Geological Rooms in Albany (two
hundred of us) and heard Prof. James Hall. We had one
lecture on “Glaciers and the <i>Mer-de-glace</i>.” We had frequent
talks by one of our number on geology, and the interest
has been rife and the profit great. We are planning
most vigorously for larger and better things. We are seeking
for an astronomer to speak to us who knows the stars as
friends, that from the living heart words may thrill us beyond
what the book can. Many adjoining towns are waking
up to this C. L. S. C. work and are pledging circles for
next year. Our membership in this city will be doubled.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Brooklyn).</b>—Our pastor, Rev. W. C. Stiles,
commenced studies with his wife, and one after another
asked permission to join them, and were cordially welcomed,
until we have a circle of seven members. Our studies
are those laid down in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. We read
the entire lesson at home, and take the most important
points for recitation. At the end of the book we have a
written review, and find we have learned the whole thing
in a very compact form. There seems to be a good deal of
interest, and we find the studies very pleasant. We decided
to elect a secretary every month and send a report to
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, so you will probably hear from us
again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Brooklyn).</b>—In the January number of <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> you ask if there are any local circles in
Brooklyn. Besides those mentioned there is one of seventy-four
members, which meets in the chapel of the New York
Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church. Rev. N. G. Cheney
is president; Mr. John E. Searles, vice-president, and Mr. J.
Wallis Cook, associate vice-president. The circle is constantly
growing, having recently absorbed part of the circle
of which F. S. Holmes was president. The members of the
circle are not confined to the Methodist denomination, but
are representatives of several others.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Greenwich).</b>—Our local circle is not only fairly
launched, but is under full sail. We number twenty-four
enthusiastic members from all the Christian denominations,
who are reading with a determination to win. We held our
second monthly meeting last evening, December 11.
Nearly every member was present and several brought
essays on subjects previously assigned them by the president
of the circle, which were well written and well read.
Very much interest was exhibited in the geological essays,
illustrated by the excellent charts. The members express
themselves as being gratified and surprised at the enthusiasm
manifested, and at the splendid success of our first
meeting. You shall hear more further on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Suspension Bridge).</b>—We have a local circle in
this place which numbers twenty-five members, and the
majority of them have their names enrolled at Plainfield,
N. J. Our order of exercises is singing (Chautauqua
hymns), roll-call, reading of minutes, program, business,
adjournment. The program for each meeting is prepared
by a committee of three, whom the president appoints two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
weeks before, and who make their report at the meeting
following their appointment. We have twenty-five questions
in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> every week, and some also in
the Greek text-book, which are asked by the chairman of
the committee that prepared the program. We are still
studying the chart, and hardly <i>see</i> how we could have used
the geology without it. We are taking the diagrams in
course, one being explained at each meeting by the member
appointed by the committee at the previous meeting. The
program always includes, also, some article or articles in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, which is read aloud by the members with frequent
consultation of the dictionary. We observe the “Memorial
Days” on the regular evening nearest memorial
date. Exercises for these are also announced by the committee
who prepare the regular program for the evening,
and consist of a sketch of the author’s life by one member,
a recitation of one of his works by another, and a short selection
by each member. Our meetings are well attended,
and all seem to enjoy them. We have taken for our name,
“The Athenian Circle.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>New York (Brocton).</b>—A local circle was reorganized in
September with a good attendance and increased interest.
We now have, in this our fifth year, a membership of
twenty and meet every Saturday evening. In addition to
our regular officers, president and secretary, we usually
elect a teacher for each subject. We are using the charts,
and the Baptist clergyman, Rev. J. M. Bates has given us
one lecture on geology and will soon give us another. The
Class of ’82 are taking the White Crystal Seal course, and
most of the members are also reading the regular course for
the year. The influence of our circle is not confined to its
members alone, but is felt throughout the village, winning
the respect of the people and increasing their desire for solid
reading.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania (Phillipsburg).</b>—Our circle has been having
some very pleasant gatherings lately, quite out of our usual
order. Some time before Christmas we first discovered we
had a neighbor circle in Houtzdale, Clearfield County, a
town about twelve miles from here, among the coal mines.
It is a much larger place than this, having a population of
between eight and ten thousand, principally miners from
almost every country in Europe. Wishing to show our
friendly feeling to our brethren in the Chautauqua Circle,
we invited them down to visit our circle. They accepted
our invitation, promising to come when the sleighing and
weather were favorable. So they telephoned to us on the
18th of last month to expect them on Monday evening, the
22d. Our circle generally meets every Tuesday evening, but
this time, to have a fuller attendance and suit all around,
we changed the time to Monday. We met rather early and
prepared to give them a warm reception. No one of us had
to our knowledge met any one of them, so we had to introduce
ourselves. We were rather surprised when they came
to find that twelve out of the twenty-five composing their
circle had ventured on the long drive, for though the moonlight
made it as bright as day, the weather was <i>very</i> cold.
The evening passed pleasantly and quickly, and it was not
till midnight that we turned our steps homeward. We departed
from our usual custom this evening and had a small
entertainment. A cup of coffee is very refreshing before a
cold sleigh ride, and we could not think of letting the party
return without breaking bread with us. Before separating
we partly promised to go up to Houtzdale to hear a lecture
on “Greece, Ancient and Modern,” on the following Wednesday.
All depended on the weather, which seemed to be
steadily growing colder. Wednesday morning the mercury
went down to 14°, but as it rose rapidly, by noon we made
what preparations were necessary, and a party of fifteen beside
the drivers started in two large sleds, after an early
supper. We reached our destination with but few mishaps
and were most kindly received. We enjoyed the lecture as
well as seeing the real Greek costumes very much. At the
close of the meeting we went to the house of one of the
members of the C. L. S. C., where we partook of a very nice
entertainment before starting for home. We all agreed that
the trip was quite a success and have promised, when warm
weather comes, to go again to visit the circle on one of its
regular meetings. We are now reading in our fifth year
and feel that we can not think of giving up, even though
some of us have our diplomas. The reading in regular
course is good for any one, and the influence of good books
and pleasant companionship drawing one out of one’s self,
away, for a short time at least, from the cares and fret of
every-day life, brings interest and brightness to many who
might otherwise give up to the “blues” and ill-temper,

<p><b>Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh).</b>—On the evening of Thursday,
January 25, the C. L. S. C. graduates of Pittsburgh and
Allegheny had their first reunion and banquet. In August
last, at Chautauqua, a committee was appointed of Pittsburgh
members to take steps for the formation of an alumni
association in that city. An organization was effected subsequently,
and the following officers elected: A. M. Martin,
president; Miss Mary Oglesby, vice-president; Miss
Sarah J. Payne, secretary; and an executive committee
composed of the preceding officers and Dr. J. J. Covert and
Miss Frances M. Sawyers. The reunion and banquet was
held at the Seventh Avenue Hotel. The members and
guests began to arrive early, and before the supper hour of
nine the parlors were filled with persons having bright
faces and happy manners. The social feature was not the
least attractive one of the evening. The banquet was served
in a private dining-hall, and forty-two persons sat down to
the feast. The table was elegantly set, and was beautiful
with fine linen, glass, and fruit. The menu was made up
of all the rich and rare delicacies usual upon such occasions.
After the last course had been served, the president of the
association, Mr. A. M. Martin, who was also master of ceremonies,
welcomed the members of the association into the
new relations of this fraternity. He said, “I bid you a
hearty welcome to the higher plane on which you have now
stepped. We are to-night, so far as I know, the first alumni
organization of the C. L. S. C. that has ever met to pay honor
to our <i>alma mater</i>. I bid you doubly welcome to the higher
halls, loftier columns, wider arches, and grander views she
now opens to your sight. We here, I believe, boast of a
larger number of the more than seventeen hundred graduates
than any other one place in the world. I bid you thrice
welcome to the honorable distinction of leading the advance
in this progressive march. Once more I welcome you all
to the enjoyments of this night, and I rejoice with you in
the happiness of the hour. I am glad to be here, and if the
faces about me are any index of your feelings, we are all
glad to be here. I hope that at every future reunion we can
echo that sentiment with the same genuine heartiness of
to-night. As we meet to enjoy the pleasures of social reunion,
we create memories that shall be new starting-points for
fresh achievements. Memories that bring gladness to the
heart are among the richest boons the Father has bestowed
upon His children. The good cheer of which we have partaken,
the sounds of the words spoken, the friendships we
have formed, the faces we have met, will live as happy
memories of this night in long years to come.” Then came
the toasts as follows: “Our lady teachers—the hope of the C.
L. S. C.;” response by Professor L. H. Eaton. “The faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>

of 1882, the pioneers of the C. L. S. C.;” response by Miss
A. E. Wilcox, with an original poem. “The Hall in the
Grove;” response by George Seebeck. “May we always be
able to look forward with pleasure, and back without regret;”
response by Miss May Wightman. “Dr. J. H. Vincent,
the greatest <i>novel</i>-ist of the age.” When this toast
was announced calls were made upon the president, Mr.
Martin, to respond. He, in reply, said: “Dr. J. H. Vincent
is a man whom it is a delight to honor. He is the originator,
the head, the inspiring spirit, the rare genius to
whom we all look as members of the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle. He is one of the greatest novelists of
the age in the old and better sense of the word, in that he is
an innovator and an asserter of novelty. He attracts our
attention; he surprises us; his methods are unusual; there
is a freshness in his plans and ways of doing and saying
things that delight us. But above all, he touches humanity
where it most needs quickening. With broad
human sympathy he comes in contact with lives where the
heart throbs beat the strongest. With deep earnestness he
reaches down to the very foundation of the impulses that
govern men and women, and seeks to direct them in higher
and better channels. He possesses eminently what some
one has called ‘sanctified common sense,’ and brings it to
bear on all phases of life. He is the greatest novelist of the
age in that he presents living and enduring truths in a way</p>

nor fainted by the way;” Miss Frances M. Sawyers. “The
hopeful outlook;” Mr. George M. Irwin. “Our city press;”

<p><b>Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).</b>—The Haddonfield local circle
has entered upon the second year of its existence, and in
looking back over the labors of the past year we feel abundantly
satisfied with the results. Our members are without
exception composed of those who have had the advantages
of a liberal education, and have been constant
readers since their school days, but have felt the want of a
systematic course to pursue, and have found in the Chautauqua
Circle this want in a certain measure supplied. We
have not only endeavored to follow in this instance the letter
of the law, but the spirit also, and in so doing have
taken the subjects up as a study, committing to memory
and reciting to our preceptor, in reply to his questions, every
work that has thus far come before us. In this way
“Quackenbos’ Ancient Classics,” as well as other works,
were thoroughly studied the past winter and reflected much
credit upon the members for the close study they gave to
them. From this severe discipline we have not deviated
and propose to continue it to the end. The fruits of such
application are already visible, and the great desire which
is expressed to confine our studies longer to one subject
than the plan permits is evidence enough of the thirst for
knowledge it engenders. The only fault we have to find
with the reading is that it is too desultory, and does not
dwell sufficiently long on one subject to satisfy the interest
which is awakened, the time of the members not permitting
them to pursue their reading out of the beaten path.
The number of our members is twelve. It could undoubtedly
be largely increased, but we feel satisfied that numbers in
our method of study would not bring corresponding strength
and might prove only a source of weakness. We congratulate
Dr. Vincent and his co-workers in the noble cause in
which they have embarked, and which has long since ceased
to be an experiment, upon the awakening of thousands of
minds to a love of acquiring knowledge, and that above all
in the interest of Christianity, and we hail that great
army of co-laborers, who, like ourselves, are brought under
its benign influences, and doubt not that this influence will
radiate from every circle for good.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania (Pottsville).</b>—There has sprung into existence,
in our midst, recently, a flourishing local circle. It is
the outgrowth of an informal conversation held by the worthy
wife of our esteemed pastor, Rev. B. T. Vincent, with
members of the Normal class of Bible students, in connection
with the M. E. Church, during the early part of last
November, in which the aims and purposes of the C. L. S.
C. were very fully explained and set forth. That an increased
interest might be created in such studies as are embraced
in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> readings, a strong sentiment
was at once manifested by those present, including members
of various denominations, in favor of organizing a local
circle. After several preliminary meetings had been held,
our circle was formally organized on the 19th of last November,
by the election of a president, vice president, secretary
and treasurer. As the result of this effort, we have in
our Mountain City to-day a circle numbering fifty-two earnest,
working members, about one half of whom are also
members of the general circle. In addition to our elective
officers, we have a committee on work, consisting of five
members, appointed by the president, whose duty it is to
arrange the work of the circle, make a sub-division of the
required readings, and assign topics in advance to the several
members, whose duty it is to present the same at the
next stated meeting of the circle in the form of an essay,
lecture, or recitation as each may deem proper. By this
method each member has his or her share of work to perform,
and all become interested and active working members.
Our meetings, which are held semi-monthly, on Saturday
evenings, are opened by a member reading a selection
from the Scriptures, followed by prayer and the singing
of the “Gloria.” The minutes of the previous meeting are
then read, and business matters relating to the circle attended
to; after which the essays on the various topics are
read, or lectures delivered. We endeavor as nearly as possible,
to so limit members that the delivery of the essays
and lectures shall not occupy more than one hour. We have
then, previous to dismissal, a half hour devoted entirely to
a lecture on the science of geology, by our president, Mr. P.
W. Sheafer. In this respect we are peculiarly favored. Mr.
Sheafer is not only a practical geologist, but from his prominent
official connection with the last geological survey of
the State, is enabled to give us a much larger, more varied
and valuable store of information in a science, which to us,
living as we do in the very centre of the vast beds of anthracite
coal, is peculiarly interesting and important.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>District of Columbia (Washington).</b>—On November 14
last a local circle was organized at the Foundry M. E.
Church, and some twenty-five persons, mostly ladies,
joined. Others have joined since, until now our membership
numbers thirty-five. Great interest is manifested, and
the outlook is encouraging. We are somewhat behind,
but we are doing double work and soon expect to be abreast
of the thousands of others who are pursuing the same
course. We have the geological diagrams, and a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
interest is being taken in geology. We are all led to thank
Dr. Vincent and Mr. Miller for introducing this movement,
and their dream must have been realized on August 12,
last. In this age of enlightenment, all who will may drink
deeply at the pure fountain of science. With the C. L. S.
C. spreading all over the earth, ignorance is a voluntary
misfortune.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Ohio (Dayton).</b>—We meet every two weeks, on Tuesday
evenings. Our circle this year has thirty members. Last
year we had a course of four lectures given at a public hall:
(1) Prof. Short, of Columbus, Ohio, “The Antiquity of Man;”
(2) Prof. Broome, of Dayton, on “Ceramics;” (3) Rev. H.
L. Colby, on “Architecture;” (4) Prof. Roberts, “Art and
Painting.” These lectures were well attended and much
enjoyed. The programs for the evenings we meet are
something like the following: Prayer by the president;
roll call and reading of the minutes of the last meeting, by
the secretary; we learn the questions and answers in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, taking fifty for a lesson, and these are
asked and answered by the society; then we have readings
and essays, on the subjects we have been reading for the
two weeks.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Ohio (Cincinnati).</b>—The Rev. Dr. Vincent being in Cincinnati
last month, attending the meeting of the Chautauqua
Trustees, the various local circles in the city, and from the
regions round about, engaged him to give a lecture in St.
Paul’s Church. At the close of the lecture Dr. Vincent was
presented with a basket of exquisite and rare flowers by the
members of the C. L. S. C., and then, called by classes, the
various circles retired to the lecture-room to welcome Chautauqua’s
chief. The royal salute was given, added to a
song of greeting. Dr. Vincent experienced great pleasure
in meeting Chautauquans—whether singly, in squads, or by
thousands—and stated that the enterprise is enlarging,
twelve thousand new members having already been added
to the former score. It is not the design to make great
scholars, but to excite desire for thorough scholarship. It
is to increase the list of students in our colleges, and to instruct
the unread and untaught that Chautauqua makes her
boast, and also in the review of former studies. A social
half hour and a hand-shaking ended the auspicious occasion,
the ladies and gentlemen of the C. L. S. C. expressing
unfeigned pleasure derived from it. A number of
C. L. S. C.’s from a distance were present, Indiana and
Kentucky being represented. Some of these visited the
members of the Cincinnati circles for the first time, and
expressed themselves much pleased with the method of
conducting the C. L. S. C. work here, and commended
especially the sociability of the members.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Tennessee (Knoxville).</b>—This is the second year of our
local circle at Knoxville. Our membership is small, numbering
only ten this year, but we are very enthusiastic, and
all the work assigned is promptly and thoroughly done.
The recitations are principally conversational. We have
just finished the “Preparatory Greek Course,” and read in
connection with it the Earl of Derby’s translation of the
“<i>Iliad</i>.” We chose Derby’s translation <i>not</i> because we differed
with Mr. Wilkinson as to its value, but because it
was the only one to which we had access. From Greece to
the stars will be quite a change, yet we are glad to leave
war and bloodshed for a time. We meet Monday night of
each week at our president’s home. Visitors are always
welcome. Our circle is so small we have never attempted
to give public entertainments or lectures, but we try in
other ways, especially by means of personal influence, to
help on the good work and gain recruits to the C. L. S. C.
army. We send greetings to our sister circles and wish
them success.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Indiana (Aurora).</b>—Our circle was organized in April,
1882, and we held our meetings and read during the summer
months to make up the course. We have twelve regular
members, all ladies. The president opens the meeting by
reading a chapter from the Bible, then the secretary reports,
after which the program for the evening is taken up. The
reading for the next week is assigned by the president, and
our aim at each meeting is to review the reading of the past
week. This is done by papers relating to the reading, or a
synopsis of the readings. Questions are assigned and answered,
and we spend considerable time in discussion. Our
meetings are always informal, and are conducted in the conversational
style.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Illinois (Sycamore).</b>—Our circle is composed of busy house-keepers
and girl graduates to the number of a full dozen.
We meet every Tuesday afternoon, and spend from one and
a half to two hours together. We take up the lessons and
readings by course, just as they are arranged in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>. We use the questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and wish there were more of them. The president
supplements them, however, and asks questions on history
of Russia, Scandinavia, or whatever is assigned for the
week. Then we read together the “Sunday Reading,” and
the poems in the “Preparatory Greek Course,” or a selection
from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, not required. Questions, discussions,
or expressions of opinion are always in order, as we
are not one bit formal. The “Geology” we much enjoyed, and
parted from it with reluctance. The “History of Greece”
we could hardly part with at all, and the “Preparatory
Greek Course” we wish the author had made twice as long.
Indeed we part from each book regretfully, but welcome
each new one joyfully. <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> is so full of
good, enjoyable articles that we can not particularize. We
find our weekly meeting delightful and if we had the time,
would like to make it a daily meeting.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Illinois (Winchester).</b>—Our circle has entered upon the
second year of its history, and it is prospering. We started
last year with seven members, out of whom four did thorough
work. We had an addition of seven new members
this year, and number at present eleven earnest, energetic
Chautauquans. Five of our circle are married ladies, three
are mothers, five are school teachers, and one a pupil in the
high school. To say we are delighted with the books and
other reading, does not express our appreciation of the good
work of Dr. Vincent and his fellow laborers. The “Ancient
Literature,” “Mackenzie’s Nineteenth Century,” and
the two Grecian works of this year are gems to be coveted by
every book collector. It seems that every new book prescribed
for us is better than the last. Some of the most attractive
features of this year’s work, exclusive of the required
study, have been a paper on the Bayeux Tapestry; a paraphrase
on a scene in the life of Agamemnon, and a select
reading descriptive of the Yosemite Valley. Two of our
members attended the Chautauqua Assembly last summer,
and others propose attending next August. Letters of inquiry
come to us from a distance asking for directions for
organizing circles, thus verifying the Biblical text: “A little
leaven leaveneth the whole lump.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Illinois (Chicago).</b>—This, the “Garfield Park Local Circle,”
was organized November 25, 1881, and now consists of six
members. We hold our meetings every Thursday evening,
at the home of one of the six. A record is kept of the work
done by each member, and after this is accomplished, our
president asks the questions given for study in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
These being answered, the subjects previously
given out for further study are treated, and we have many
interesting and instructive answers. Talks and discussions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
follow, after which the work for the coming week is assigned,
the minutes taken, and we adjourn for music and a
social time. We were much helped in geology by the diagrams,
and, indeed, it seems as though almost every written
article is in some way connected with our studies.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Illinois (Jacksonville).</b>—A local circle was organized October,
1880, in the house of Mr. Frank Read. It has now
entered its third year, and numbers seven members, almost
all of whom are deaf-mute ladies, and teachers in the institution
for deaf-mutes. Miss Naomi S. Hiatt is the secretary
of this circle, and Miss Lavinia Eden the vice-president. The
exercises consist of answers to the questions for the week in
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, of answers to five surprise questions
prepared by each member, of comparing notes, and of the
leader’s review on the required readings for the week. The
members by turn conduct meetings each Tuesday evening,
at Mr. Frank Read’s house. Their daily reading and study
seem difficult and tedious, but the interest in such work
awakens and increases with each meeting. The exercises
are conducted by means of spelling on the fingers; but the
subjects, especially the tales from Shakspere, become very
interesting through the medium of such uniquely luminous
and intensely vital language as signs. This local circle is
not only a great help to their professional work, but also an
excellent means of contributing to their social, mental, and
spiritual welfare. They all expect to be perennial Chautauquans.</p>

<p><b>Michigan (Kalamazoo).</b>—We have recently organized a local
circle here with an enrollment of twelve enthusiastic

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Michigan (Flushing).</b>—Our class, the “Hope Society,” has
a membership of twenty-two. We meet once a week at the
residence of each member in turn. The meeting is opened
by singing and prayer, and at roll-call of members each one
responds with some Scripture text or literary gem. We
have a committee of arrangements, consisting of nine persons,
to plan work for the class and prepare such questions
as they think best. Three of them take the work each
alternate week. We have also a committee on entertainments
to procure lecturers and look to the social interest of
the work. We do our reading at home, and meet to review,
recite, suggest, and encourage each other, and our rules
require an essay a week from some one of the class. This
is our third year and we are working with increasing enthusiasm.
One young man walks seven miles nearly every
week to attend the meeting. We keep all the memorial
days, and pray always, God bless Chautauqua.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Michigan (Sault St. Marie).</b>—The Rev. L. T. Eastendy
writes: We have fifteen members in our local circle. We
meet once a week. We have done October’s work, interchanging
in the schedule “Preparatory Greek Course” and
“History of Greece.” My wife, daughter and I enjoy our
home circle very much. I have just closed my seventeen
years pastorate with the Presbyterian church here, on account
of ill health, and hope now to enjoy this work and do
good in it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><b>Michigan (Detroit.)</b>—Five years ago a circle was formed
here, with Mrs. A. L. Clarke as president. Our officers are
elected once a year. They consist of a president, vice president,
critic, treasurer, recording and corresponding secretaries.
Three committees attend to the business of preparing
the program for each evening, and the celebration of the
memorial days, and are appointed by the president every
three months. The instruction committee consists of five
members, and apportions the work among the members.
The music committee, consisting of six members, arranges
the musical program for each evening. The entertainment
committee consists of eight persons, who arrange the program
for the socials, and take charge of the refreshments.
The circle meets weekly on Thursday evenings. Meeting
called to order at eight o’clock. Music, either vocal or instrumental
opens the meeting pleasantly. The recording
secretary reads the minutes of the preceding meeting. The
critic’s report follows, and the work of the evening is then
begun, on subjects assigned to members. The subject may
be treated in the form of an essay, short lecture, black-board
illustration, or a preparation to answer any questions that
may be asked. All members are expected to take the subjects
assigned them by the instruction committee. During
the evening we have a recess of fifteen or twenty minutes,
when new members are welcomed and introduced, and the
committees can assign the work for the next meeting. After
recess the program is finished, and the meeting is closed at
10 p. m., with more music. We try to have a lecture by
some popular speaker at least once a month. Thus far
we have had lectures from Dr. Yemans on “Geology;” Dr.
Taylor, Post Surgeon at Fort Wayne, on “Storms and their
Causes;” Mr. Hawley, on “Rain, Hail and Snow;” Mr.
Taylor, on “Geology,” and Rev. George D. Baker, on “God’s
hand in American History.” After the lecture opportunity
is given to members to ask questions on any points not
quite clear to them. Besides the regular meetings we celebrate
the memorial days by giving a reception to the members
and friends of the C. L. S. C. at the house of the president
or of some member. The entertainment consists of
music, a sketch of the poet’s life, and reading of selections
from his works; refreshments and conversation complete
the evening. In the summer, picnics are given by the
members, and when the wintry days are come, the Chautauquans
sometimes go sleigh-riding. Drawn thus together
we form a most harmonious band. Our circle at present
consists of eighty-one members, thirty-three of whom are
general members. Nearly all of these have joined us since
September, 1881. The first four years the circle met in the
rooms of the Y. M. C. A., and averaged about thirty for each
year. In September, 1882, it was decided to rent the “Conservatory
of Music Hall,” it being a larger hall and nearer
the central portion of the city. We have had no cause to
regret the action taken, as the meetings are so well attended,
and the members are so thoroughly instructed in the work.
Our circle is composed of persons who range in age from
fifteen to sixty-five years, and of many different lands and
callings; physicians, lawyers, teachers, clerks, and busy
housewives clasp hands in one grand and glorious circle.
Eight diplomas were awarded to members last year. Several
of these graduates are now working for seals upon their
diplomas. Death has deprived us of but one member, Miss
Ida Ashley, who was so faithful, earnest and persevering.
She finished her studies while lying upon what proved to be
her death bed. Her diploma came just before she passed to
her eternal home, and her memory will ever be revered in
our circle.</p>

<p><b>Missouri (Carthage).</b>—Our circle was organized last April
with five members. Officers elected under forms of constitution
in C. L. S. C. Hand Book. Applications and fees for
membership sent Miss Kimball for class of 1886. We appointed
weekly meetings at the homes of members and
spent three hours at each meeting reading Knight’s “English
History,” and review papers enlarging upon the main
topics and prominent characters, with a few moments given
to criticisms and report of general news items of interest.
June 1, in connection with the literary societies of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
city, we organized a Carthage Literary Association, membership
forty or more, all ladies, and held a “Longfellow
Memorial Meeting,” a highly entertaining and profitable
occasion, being entirely of a literary character. The members
of the C. L. S. C. are now pursuing the year’s course
with renewed zeal, and we number seventeen regular members.
A class conductor is appointed for each week. Papers
of an interesting and creditable character are read relating
to the Greek heroes, both real and mythical, one member
giving a prose recitation from memory of the “Iliad” and
“Odyssey,” also Sophocles’ “King Œdipus.” We are
now preparing for a Miltonian memorial. Our only regret
is that we did not fall into C. L. S. C. line earlier. We
would give a hearty God bless Dr. Vincent and Chautauqua.</p>

deal of interest has been manifested, during the present season,
in the work of the C. L. S. C., and meetings have been
held in a large number of the city churches, with very gratifying
results. We beg now to intimate that a general meeting
will be held in the Metropolitan Church (lecture room)
on Tuesday evening, next, the 19th inst., to which we invite—(1)
All members of the C. L. S. C., and those desiring
to become such; and (2) Any who feel interested, in
any way, in the substitution of pure and healthy literature
for that which is questionable and sometimes baneful in its
tendency, and in the cultivation of the habit of reading in a
given course, with the object of mental development. The
meeting will be addressed by the Rev. H. Johnston, M. A.,
B. D., and others, and opportunity will be given for questioning,
to elicit any needed information. As this matter
of home reading is one, the importance of which it would
be difficult to over-estimate, we earnestly request that you
will use the means which may seem most proper to you to
make this meeting known to the members of your congregation.”</p>

——<br />
<small>TO QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY IN THE JANUARY<br />
NUMBER OF “THE CHAUTAUQUAN.”</small></h2>

<hr class="shorter" />
<p class='center'>By ALBERT M. MARTIN, <span class="smcap">General Secretary</span> C. L. S. C.</p>

<p>1. The expression, “Possession is nine points in the law,”
probably had its origin in an old Scottish proverb, “Possession
is eleven points in the law, and they say there are but
twelve.” It is found in a play by Colley Cibber, called
“Woman’s Wit,” reading “Possession is eleven points of the
law.” Later, DeQuincey uses the expression in a criticism
of Shakspere’s drama of “King Lear,” in the form employed
by our author. DeQuincey says: “The best of
Shakspere’s dramas, ‘King Lear,’ is the least fitted for representation,
and even for the vilest alteration. It ought, in
candor, to be considered that possession is nine points in
the law.” It occurs in the writings of a number of writers
of the present century with a change of the numeral.</p>

<p>2. The preying sadness that Cowper sought to escape from
by the work of translating Homer was occasioned by disappointment
in youth; attempted suicide; dread of everlasting
punishment, and fear of insanity. A romantic attachment
for his cousin in his youth met with the disfavor
of his father. Doubts of his ability to fill the requirements
of an office for which he was named so preyed upon his
mind that he attempted suicide. After this he believed that
in that act he had committed a deadly sin, and he could
only see between him and heaven a high wall which he
despaired of ever being able to scale. He possessed a naturally
melancholy temperament, and was subject to insanity,
of which he had a great dread. He began the translation
of Homer into blank verse to divert his mind from morbid
introspection, and he succeeded so well that the six years
he spent in this labor were among the happiest of his life.</p>

<p>3. The original of the quotation, “From the center to the
utmost pole,” is to be found in Milton’s “Paradise Lost,”
book I, line 74. The quotation is not, however, literally
made. In Milton it reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“As far removed from God and light of heav’n,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As from the center thrice to th’ utmost pole.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Pope also uses a similar expression in his lines reading:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>4. Macedonia’s madman was Alexander the Great. He
was so called because he was dazzled or crazed with his own
success; from his rash and impetuous disposition, and the
many acts of inhumanity he perpetrated; because his horrible
butchery and cruelty at times indicated a species of
madness; because his brilliant successes so turned his head
that he sought to be worshiped as the son of a god. Byron,
in his Age of Bronze, refers to him as the madman in these
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How vain, how worse than vain, at length appear</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The madman’s wish, the Macedonian tear.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He wept for worlds to conquer—half the earth</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Knows not his name, or but his death and birth.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>5. Some of the features of the Cathedral of Cologne that
render it famous are as follows: It is considered one of the
finest monuments of Gothic architecture in existence. It
contains the shrine of the three kings, or magi, who visited
and worshiped the infant Savior, and their reputed bones.
It is the largest Gothic church in the world. It was begun
in 1248 and finished in 1881—six hundred and thirty-two
years in building. It is the loftiest building in the world,
the tower being about five hundred feet high. Its beauty is
in its exquisite proportions, and it does not invite long study
to appreciate its grandeur. It has beautiful stained-glass
windows, a double range of flying buttresses, a perfect forest
of pinnacles. Under a slab in the pavement the heart
of Maria de Medici is buried. The cathedral is in the form
of a cross, 510 feet long and 231 feet broad. The roof rests
on 100 columns, of which the four center ones are 30 feet in
circumference.</p>

<p>6. The expression “Perish the thought” probably had its
origin in a speech of Gloucester, interpolated by Colly Cibber,
in Shakspere’s “Richard the Third.” The reading
there is “Perish that thought,” and is to be found in Bell’s
edition of Shakspere’s plays as performed at Drury Lane
Theater. The part of the speech containing the expression
is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Perish that thought! No, never be it said</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That fate itself could awe the soul of Richard,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hence, babbling dreams; you threaten here in vain;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Conscience, avaunt, Richard’s himself again!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>7. The lines of Pope in his paraphrase of the moonlight
scene, given in the closing part of the eighth book of the
Iliad, are “false and contradictory” in the following particulars:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
The planets do not revolve around the moon. The
stars do not make bright the pole. Those near the pole are
scarcely visible on such a night. It is not a correct translation
of the original. The light on a moonlight scene is
mild, subdued and silvery, and therefore is not glorious,
yellow and golden. It is contradictory, because he says
the stars gild the pole, and cast a yellow verdure o’er the
trees, and at the same time tip with silver the mountain
heads. He speaks of a flood of glory bursting from all the
skies which he calls blue. The night filled with the noises
of neighing coursers and ardent warriors, waiting for the
morn, could not be like the one “when not a breath disturbs
the deep serene.”</p>

<p>8. Webster’s famous seventh of March speech was delivered
in the United States Senate on the seventh of March,
1850. The occasion was the discussion of a series of resolutions
submitted by Mr. Clay in reference to the admission
of California as a State, and embodying a basis of a proposed
compromise of all differences relating to the territories
and to slavery. In this speech Mr. Webster took
ground against the abolitionists; against further legislation
prohibitory of slavery in the territories; against secession
or disunion; against whatever seemed calculated to produce
irritation or alienation between the North and the
South. In consideration of its character, and the manner
in which it was received by the people throughout the
country, it has been entitled, “For the Constitution and the
Union.”</p>

<p>9. Athene was called the “Stern-Eyed” because she was
considered the goddess of pure reason, raised above every
feminine weakness, and disdaining love; because of her
martial mein; also, that no flattery or other influence could
deter her from executing justice alike on friend or foe. She
watched over Athens to protect it from outward foes; consequently
she was watchful, or “stern-eyed.” She generally
appeared with a countenance full more of masculine
firmness and composure than of softness and grace.</p>

<h3>HOW TO READ TOGETHER PROFITABLY.</h3>

<p>After singing, by the choir, “Arise and Shine,” and “The
Winds are Whispering,” Dr. Vincent said: “I greet you.
We are glad that so many of us are able to be present this
afternoon. We are here to-day for a practical question or
two in connection with our work as local circles, and then
to answer some questions relating to the exercises of the
coming Saturday. It is a question of much importance to
all who are connected with local circles: How may we promote
profitable reading? A local circle is not designed for
much reading, but is a place to guide people in reading at
home; to make suggestions; to correct blunders; to give
new ideas that reading may be prosecuted with economy of
time. A large part of almost any book may be omitted by
every reader, and yet he may after a fashion read the parts
he “omits.” There is a rapid way of running over half a
dozen pages when they contain but the expansion or illustration
of a thought. You see what the author is after;
you have read the half-dozen pages; you have all that is for
you in those pages, and saved your time for a page that you
can not finish in fifteen minutes or half an hour. It is often
the case that when out of a book of three hundred pages
you have read forty pages of it studiously, you have the
essence of that book.</p>

<p>There are very few men who can write a book, every
page of which is worth the concentrated attention of the
average reader. Many a book that costs one dollar and a half
contains only a half-dollar’s worth. Learn to find and make
your own that half-dollar’s worth.</p>

<p>It may be well occasionally in a local circle for one member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to read a chapter, or paragraph, or section, of one, two,
three, four, or more pages, and let the rest listen, noting
every word, watching his pronunciation, or trying to take
in all that they can while he reads. The habit of attention
while another reads may be more profitable than reading for
oneself. When the page has been read in the hearing of
the other two, if the circle be a triangle, or the other twenty,
if the circle be a very large circle, then let one, two, or three,
as many as you have time to hear, try to repeat the substance
of what was read. We had at Island Park the other
day in a round-table conference, a very interesting exercise
of that kind. I took up a book, the newest and last—it was
Hatton’s account of a trip through America. I read to them
a page of that. I read it so rapidly that it was almost impossible
for anybody to follow me. They heard me. I pronounced
every word distinctly, but read as rapidly as I
could. And there was precious little to recall. And then
I read another part of the book very slowly. There were a
great many dates in it. It was an account of the settlement
of Kansas, and the growth of Kansas and Missouri, and the
settlement of Nebraska. I read the figures slowly, but did
not repeat. When I finished I closed the book, and then
recalled through the class the substance of what I had read.
It was very gratifying to find how much they could remember,
and to me it was very gratifying to see how many forgot
dates, and it was exceedingly gratifying to find one old
Presbyterian minister, whose life certainly was not a failure,
able to remember all the figures, and <i>he</i> felt very much
gratified. Now, an exercise of that kind will do good to
everybody in the class, the reader doing his best to give to
all the rest a few facts for recollection, and the listeners trying
to recall. And what one fails to recall, the others recall,
and at last you get out of a class of ten or twenty the substance
of all that was read in the hearing of all the members.</p>

<p>Sometimes the reading for the next week or month may
be anticipated in a little class. We are, for example, to read
a certain chapter this week from Timayenis’s Greek History.
“Now, as I have read that chapter,” says the leader, or one
of the members, “I find general great ideas, or periods, or
points. They are as follows:” Now, no one but himself
has read that chapter. He gives them the general great
thoughts, or centers, of that chapter or book, which they
are to read the coming week. All the members going from
that local circle will take up that chapter and read it that
week with greater profit than if they had not enjoyed the
preview. In the same way have a review of the reading of
the last week. Get members to read with thoughtfulness,
and with the intention of presenting again what they read.
When I read up for entertainment, I read rapidly and with
fifty per cent. of my attention. When I read up with a
view of reinforcing my position, or preparing myself for a
discussion of a subject, I read with one hundred per cent. of
my attention. When people read because it must be read,
they will read it in one way. When people read for the
sake of telling it again, they read it another way, and that
other way is the way to read. [Laughter.] And the local
circle encouraging the habit of expression, whether in writing
or otherwise at the time, will promote attention in
reading.</p>

<p>Once in awhile in a local circle, one may read as an illustration
of the most profitable way of personal and private
reading. For example, let Mr. A. B. take two pages of
Timayenis’s Greek, or of the little book on Geology, and let
him read two pages, stopping and talking to himself aloud,
as he would if alone. He finds a word that he does not understand.
He says, “I do not know the meaning of that
word. I think it has some reference to so and so.” He
turns to his dictionary and finds out what it means. He
finds a classical allusion and says, “I do not think I can
tell what it means, or how to pronounce that word. I must
look in the dictionary. Here is an obscure thought I can
not fully understand.” And he reads it over. When a
thoughtful man or woman has read through one page of a
book in that way, revealing all his thoughts and processes
while he reads, he helps other people to read intelligently,
slowly, thoughtfully, and they learn the art of reading alone
with a mastery of the attention. There might also be five
minute synopses of the book. Divide a book that has been
read into periods or sections. Miss A. gives a five-minute
synopsis of a certain period, Miss B. another, Miss C. another.
This review helps everybody to remember.</p>

<p>I think it would be a very good plan for each member of
a local circle to mark in his book passages which most impress
him. I never read a book which I own, and never a
book owned by a friend of mine, whom I know with a tolerable
degree of intimacy, without marking it. I have
marked the passages that impressed me in every book in my
library which I have read. When I mark a book the passages
marked are the things in that book that belong to me.
I can re-read it in a very short time. I believe there is a
strange law of mental affinity, by which a soul takes hold
of the thoughts in a book that are for him. I believe if the
members were some evening to bring their books, were to
have the marked passages read, on given pages, the comparison,
the variety and the repetition would all make the
exercise extremely interesting and profitable.</p>

<p>Have you additional hints to give about reading in our
local circles to profit? Let me hear from you now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: How are we to examine the dictionary
when the scheme of the first two months of the next year in
the required time allows only two minutes to the page?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span>: Let them take more time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Mr. Martin, will you read to me the books
that are required from this list?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: The Historical Course of Timayenis, parts
3, 4, and 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: You have two months for that; 125 to 380.
What next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: “Chautauqua Text-book of Greek History,”’
and “Geology” by Packard. The remaining reading for
October and November is to be published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
You see that more than half is in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: That is an estimate of Dr. Flood for some
other year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: It is published in this article.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: It may be that during the year there will
be as much in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> as in all the books for
the year, but I am very doubtful if you will double the reading
for October and November in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. I
say that in a local circle one may examine all the classical
allusions, one may examine all the difficult words, or a
committee may be appointed for that purpose, and you can
economize time by a division of labor. That is one of the
benefits of local circles. How many pages of required reading
in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span>: About thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: About sixty pages, then, in October and
November. Now for December. What are we to read during
that month?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: The “Preparatory Greek Course in English.”
That is to be read in December and January, with
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for these two months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: February?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: Warren’s “Astronomy,” and his little
text-book on the stars. That extends over two months,
February and March, and for April we have the Hampton
Tracts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: They are very small, and can be read in
an hour. Go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: In May is “Evangeline;” in June you
have nothing but the little Chautauqua Text-book on China.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: That is all. My friends, we do not have a
very difficult course for the next year. You will have
plenty of time to examine the difficult points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>: I only asked the question for October and
November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: It may be a little more difficult in October
and November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. J. A. Foster</span>: Suppose a person with plenty of
time can take the four years in three years, have you any
objection?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: There is a little objection. We prefer to
occupy the time with the four years, because there are so
many studies possible. Let the person who has so much
time take the special courses and thus make the diploma at
the end of the four years so much more valuable. I do not
like to crowd the four years into three. There have been a
few cases in which that has been done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span>: Can a graduate of 1882 commence and take
the course over again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Yes, sir. I hope the most of them will,
and get a white crystal seal on the diploma every year,
reading a certain part of the books, not all of them. The
current course is prescribed in the circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span>: If the ’82s come on as rapidly for the four
years to come as in the four years past, where will we be
then? [Laughter.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Nearer heaven. [Laughter.] You will
have, for example, this admirable history of Greece in two
volumes. You will have this series of four books in Latin
and Greek. And what delights me is that the college people
are charmed with this “Preparatory Greek Course in English.”
It is a marvelous book. I did not write it. A scholarly
man, who examined it the other day, said, “Why,
every boy who goes to college should read that before he
goes.” There is the substance of all that the boy studies in
the grammar school and preparatory school before he enters
college; there it is all in English, and in a more available
form than that in which the boy gets it. I do not mean to
say that you have more than the boy. He secures the mental
drill and a foundation of linguistic knowledge. He gets
what you can not get, but you secure an intelligent view of
the college world through which he passes as a student of
Greek. The questions for further study, published in <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>, were of much value in our local circles.
Can we have something like it next year? Those who request
Dr. Flood to make arrangements for the publication
in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> of a series of questions for further
study, raise your hands. Down. Best raise them in a numerous
request.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Written question</span>: Is a new four years’ course to commence
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: The new four years’ course is the old four
years’ course revised, and with many modifications. We
take astronomy, the same text-book somewhat revised.
We take English history with not so much attention to it.
We took a little Greek history before, too; now we take a
good deal of Greek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Written question</span>: If one has read the four years’ course
and sent in only the first year’s papers, but has all the other
papers partly made out, what will that person do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Send in, as you ought to have done, that
little two-page slip, giving all the books you have read, answer
“R” or “E.” Persons having done that will meet the
requirements of the Circle. This paper we sent to every
member of the class of ’82, for testimony concerning the
amount of reading that has been done. I do hope that representative
local circles will supply themselves with these
geological charts, which are so admirable for use in local
circles, in Sunday-schools, in lecture rooms, and at home.
Indeed, they are a good thing to have about the house for a
private family. With this book in hand the mother may
be a lecturer in geology, and have the pictures to represent
these matters. I hope we can encourage the publishers of
the geological charts, who went to great expense in the
preparation of these, so that we can have other charts in the
other matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span>: Can a person who has not taken the regular
course take up any special course and receive a certificate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Persons who have never taken the regular
course may take any special course and receive a certificate
to that fact, but they will miss the circles, and the Hall in
the Grove, and the arches, and the central office.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STUDY_OF_FRENCH" id="THE_STUDY_OF_FRENCH">THE STUDY OF FRENCH.</a></h2>

<hr class="shorter" />
<p class='center'>By <span class="smcap">Prof. A. LALANDE, Professor of French in the Chautauqua School of
Languages</span>.</p>


<p>From the beginning I have followed as scrupulously as
possible the most <i>natural method</i> of teaching, and I propose
to continue this method in the School of Languages at
Chautauqua.</p>

<p>At the same time I desire to unite with my system
of teaching a new manner of studying the French language,
to which I call the attention of the curious and intelligent
public which meets every year in our schools.</p>

<p>I will assemble every day in my class-room those who do
not know a word of French and those who have already
studied French, but who can not yet speak it. We will read
together either a part of a fable from La Fontaine, or a few
lines from some other well-known French author.</p>

<p>In the beginning I will translate the passage literally,
then after being quite certain that each word is thoroughly
understood, we will read together the text, slowly at first,
syllable by syllable, and then more rapidly, uniting the
words and giving to them the musical cadence peculiar to
the French tongue. Afterward I will question the scholars
<i>in</i> French upon the lesson.</p>

<p>Each day the scholars will read the same fable or the same
passage, until the pronunciation is good, and commit a few
lines to memory, not, however, before they are able to give
the passage that harmony which can only come from a page
well understood.</p>

<p>These recitations (which are essential) will not only
strengthen the memory, but will teach them the grammar
and dictionary of the French language, at the same time
familiarizing them with the best authors.</p>

<p>If after a few weeks they commit to memory several fables
and pages from our great writers, they ought to gradually
become able to read and understand without the aid of the
teacher’s translation.</p>

<p>Will I succeed?</p>

<p>Time will show, but failure is hardly possible when one is
inspired by the spirit which reigns at Chautauqua, and encouraged
by a public as intelligent as that which assembles
in our schools.</p>

<p>One can scarcely be insensible of the advantages derived
from the study of French. From the early mediæval ages
it has been the language of poetry and refinement, and one
can scarcely lay claim to a finished education unless familiar
with this tongue.</p>

<p>Too much can not well be said in its favor, as it is not only
a polite and musical language, but a familiarity with its
great authors will open an avenue of the highest enjoyment
to students of good literature; for it is a well-known
fact that the beauties of any language are lost by translation.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />


<h3>The C. L. S. C. as a Substitute for the Public Library.</h3>

<p>Reading in a desultory manner, without system, plan, or
purpose, as is the habit of many people who patronize public
libraries, is productive of but little benefit. One may go
through many volumes, and acquire much information, but
it will be in a crude, unsystematic state, and can not be
utilized in many practical ways. In public libraries the
people are almost wholly devoted to reading works of fiction.
This is the testimony of librarians. Its truthfulness
may also be seen by any one who will casually examine
the books of any library open to the public. Works of
fiction bear the marks of almost constant perusal, while the
standard works of history, science, philosophy and literature
show signs of but little use and remain uncalled for
upon the shelves for weeks at a time. The constant reading
of fiction is deleterious in the extreme, as it not only
gives the individual addicted to it false and distorted views
of life, but it is also sure to render the mind unfit for the
consideration of all serious and weighty subjects, and begets
a distaste for solid reading of any and every kind.</p>

<p>In many respects the C. L. S. C. is a great improvement
on the reading-room or the public library, and may prove,
in a good degree, a valuable substitute for both. There can
be little doubt but that the time spent in reading the course
prescribed for its members will be productive of much
better results than if given up to reading in a hap-hazard
manner. The increased advantages to be obtained may be
briefly summed up as follows:</p>

<p>In the first place, the books prescribed in the C. L. S. C.
course of study have been selected after the most careful
consideration by persons well qualified for the task. A
number of the works have been prepared expressly for the
use of the C. L. S. C., and are models of compactness, brevity
and style. The course of study is not confined to any one
department of literature, but comprises works of history,
and science, philosophy and poetry, and a wide range of
literature and topics of general interest. Works of fiction
are reduced to a minimum, and those admitted to the course
are unobjectionable both in character and matter.</p>

<p>Second—The course of reading is pursued in a methodical
and orderly manner. A portion of each day is to be set
apart for the required reading, and though the allotted time
is brief, it is sufficient to secure habits of systematic study.
A regular plan is insisted upon. Each work is to be read in
the order assigned to it and written examinations are conducted
on the portions read. Thus the evils resulting from
careless and desultory methods of reading are counteracted
and wholesome and systematic habits of study are inculcated.</p>

<p>Third—The solitary reader often finds his task monotonous
and tiresome, and at times his perusal of books is unproductive
because his faculties are not aroused to their
highest state of action. But in the C. L. S. C. such a condition
of things is largely avoided. A number of persons in
common pursue the same course of reading, with frequent
meetings for conversation concerning the books and topics
under consideration. By this means they are afforded frequent
opportunities for mutual interchange of ideas on the
subjects to which their minds are simultaneously directed
and they are thus stimulated to greater mental activity,
and their work is freed from all tedium and weariness.
While the C. L. S. C. has many benefits to offer to people
in cities and large towns, even though they may possess the
advantages of reading-rooms, libraries and lecture courses,
it is of especial profit to those who dwell in small towns and
in the rural districts. In but few of such communities are
libraries of any kind to be found, and means for self-culture
are often meagre in the extreme. The C. L. S. C. offers a
course of reading adapted to their wants. It is extensive
and yet not costly, and may be pursued by the busiest men
and women if they are only economical of time.</p>

<p>Let any one who sighs for the advantages to be derived from
reading-rooms, enter upon the studies prescribed for the C.
L. S. C., and at the end of his four years’ course, compare
notes with any one who has spent his leisure in that kind
of reading that is common in public libraries, and he will
find he has made great gain.</p>

<h3>“Dr. Grimshawe’s Secret.”</h3>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was, without doubt, the most powerful
writer in the field of romance which our country has
produced. His fame was of slow growth, but as the years
have passed it has been continually swelling and widening,
and his name is certain to long hold a foremost place in
American literature. He lived long enough to see some
recognition of his genius, but since his death, in 1864, he
has been read and praised as he never was in his life. Various
editions of his works have been published, and whatever
products of his pen, not published in his life-time,
from time to time have come to light, have been put into
print and have been eagerly read. Undoubtedly much, if
not all, of the posthumous Hawthorne literature would never
have been given to the public if his own wishes had been
carried out. His shy and sensitive nature is well known.
It could not have been grateful to him to have his personality
brought before the world as it has been since his death.
It was his request that his life should not be written, but
already there are no less than four Hawthorne biographies,
and two more are in preparation. And who doubts that if
he could have foreseen the publication of the notes, fragments,
and studies for stories which were written simply as
memoranda, suggestions and helps to be used in the preparation
of his works, he would have taken good care that
they should not be left behind him? No writer ever elaborated
his works with greater care. Each story which he
himself gave to the world is perfect in style, and a finished
work of art. And to have such crude and hasty work made
into books, as much published with his name since his
death is, is almost enough to cause this exquisite literary
artist to turn in his grave.</p>

<p>Soon after Hawthorne’s death the opening chapters of
“The Dolliver Romance,”—a story which he left unfinished—were
published. Later came the publication of his
“American Note Books,” “English Note Books,” and
“French and Italian Note Books.” In 1872 the story “Septimius
Felton, or the Elixir of Life,” which had been found
among his manuscripts, was edited by his daughter and published.
It seems quite clear that it was Hawthorne’s intention
to merge this story in “The Dolliver Romance,” and
that, if he had lived to complete the latter work, no “Septimius
Felton” would ever have seen the light. But this
was not the last of the fragmentary work of this author
which the world was to see. Not long since it was announced
that another work from Hawthorne’s pen had been
found, and would be published. We now have it—“Dr.
Grimshawe’s Secret.” Recently, also, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>
and <i>The Century</i> have given us, under the titles, “The Ancestral
Footstep,” and “A Look Into Hawthorne’s Workshop,”
certain Hawthorne fragments in which this story is
sketched. And the question now for the critics to decide is
whether in “Dr. Grimshawe’s Secret” we have the fulfillment
of the studies in these fragments, or whether this published
story is itself but a sketch and study, to be fulfilled
with the others in a romance which was long germinating
in the great author’s mind, but which death came too soon
for him to execute. Certainly “Dr. Grimshawe’s Secret”
Hawthorne himself would never have published as it is. It
is no finished work of his own. There has been incredulity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
on the part of some as to his having written any part of it.
But it is in part his work, clearly enough; and how much
of it is his and how much the editor’s—who is his son, Julian
Hawthorne—readers must conjecture for themselves.
When asked to take this as substantially a complete work
of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s, we decline. Evidently it is not
so. His hand of power is seen in it at times, but it is very
unequal, and as a whole it is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>We have not the space to give an analysis of the book. It
will be widely read. Of the lovers of Hawthorne the name
is legion, and nothing to which his name is attached is
likely to be passed by unnoticed. But that it can add nothing
to his fame goes without saying. Indeed, if it could be
believed that it is really Hawthorne’s work, that he wrote
it as a whole, to publish substantially as it is, it might have
the opposite effect. But it will doubtless be very generally
regarded as one among the many posthumous Hawthorne
fragments. A much more powerful story than “Dr. Grimshawe’s
Secret,” as we have it, was struggling in the brain
of this rare literary genius, and in the course of time would
have come forth had not death stepped in with the inevitable
summons. For this unwritten romance, what we have
been reading in the magazines, and what we have in this
recent book, were but the studies. These various Hawthorne
fragments are interesting, as showing his methods
of work, but again we say he would not have wished them
published.</p>

<h3>The Joseph Cook Lectureship.</h3>

<p>The seventh annual course of the Boston Monday Lectureship
by Rev. Joseph Cook is once more in progress.
The whole number delivered by the lecturer from this platform
has reached, up to this date, the remarkable count of
one hundred and fifty-four. Add to these the preludes, each
of which is a lecture in itself, upon the most vital and interesting
questions of the times, and we have an aggregate
of twice the original number. It is with unabated interest
and delight that the vast audience of readers of these lectures
resumes their perusal. It is, perhaps, not too much to
say that no platform or pulpit has so vast or so intelligent an
auditory. Before and during Mr. Cook’s recent absence he
was subjected to the rigid, and sometimes personal, criticism
of the free-thinking and rationalistic critics, but he
returns to find his old audience already in their pews waiting
to receive the riches of thought and criticism which he
has gathered and matured during his sojourn abroad.</p>

<p>These lectures by Mr. Cook are reassuring in many ways,
in nothing, perhaps, more than in the evidence they furnish
of the interest which the masses feel in orthodox Christianity.
If the croakers, who moan and groan at the prospect
of an expiring faith in the Gospel of Christ, will take
the trouble to compare the numbers and character of the
readers of these lectures with the same of those who read
the scoffing and infidel publications of the day, they will feel
better. And besides those who read and ponder for themselves,
and profit by the thoughts and facts announced from
this platform, there are many pulpits to which they are a
sort of tonic, stimulating to greater faith and reliance, in
public teaching, on the old truths and methods of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook’s lectures give evidence of indefatigable industry
aided by marvelous powers of memory. Though scarcely
reached the prime of life as measured by years, he has traversed
the field of thought and investigation as few men in
a whole lifetime have done, and has brought with him
the facts and conclusions which he has found, all classified
and subject to his command. An omnivorous reader, he is
the largest living library in the world, and thoroughly indexed
almost to the page and line. All these conditions of
fitness and qualification for the work are supplemented by the
genius and qualities of the orator. As such, Mr. Cook is
entitled to the foremost rank. Magnetism, rhetoric, voice,
physique, strength, striking metaphor, apt and classic illustration,
all in a high degree are possessed by this colossus of
the platform.</p>

<p>Many of our readers have had the pleasure of seeing and
hearing him at Chautauqua. They will be glad to know
that he will stand again in the Amphitheater the coming
summer.</p>

<h3>Gustave Doré.</h3>

<p>This celebrated French artist died at his home in Paris
January 23. His illness was very brief, and his death entirely
unexpected. He was cut down in the midst of his
years, having just passed his fiftieth birthday. His life was
one of remarkable industry. No busier pencil than his was
ever stopped by the hand of death.</p>

<p>He was born at Strasburg, January 6, 1833, and came to
Paris while very young, where he received his education.
He began his work as an artist in boyhood, furnishing designs
at first for cheap illustrated books and papers. When
he was about fifteen years of age, some of his pen and ink
sketches and paintings were put on exhibition at the Salon.
Not long after he had gained a reputation and did not want
for abundance of remunerative employment.</p>

<p>Doré was designer, painter, etcher, and sculptor, all. It
is said that he made nearly 50,000 different designs during
his life; and some one has estimated that all his works of
different kinds, placed in line, would reach from Paris to
Lyons.</p>

<p>It was as a designer that he was most successful and
popular. His illustrations of “The Wandering Jew”—first
published in 1856—made him famous the world over. It is
the judgment of critics that these illustrations he never excelled.
He began at his best, it has been remarked. Some
of his first important works were equal to any he ever executed.
Among other books which he illustrated, may be
mentioned, Rabelais, Montaigne’s “Journal,” Taine’s “<i>Voyage
aux Pyrenees</i>,” Dante’s works, Chateaubriand’s “Atala,”
“Don Quixote,” “Paradise Lost,” the Bible, Tennyson’s
“Idyls of the King,” La Fontaine’s “Fables,” and Coleridge’s
“Ancient Mariner.” For some time before his death
he was engaged in illustrating Shakspere, and it is understood
that Harper and Brothers will shortly issue an edition
of Poe’s “Raven,” with illustrations of his designing.
Among Doré’s many paintings, his “Christ leaving the
Prætorium”—which measures thirty feet by twenty—and
“Entrance of Christ into Jerusalem”—also a colossal picture—are
perhaps the most celebrated. Of the latter it has
been said that over it “the critics smiled and Christians
wept.” Other of his well-known pictures are “The Triumph
of Christianity,” “The Neophyte,” “The Gambling Hall
at Baden-Baden,” and “The Rebel Angels Cast Down.”</p>

<p>Doré was the most popular of modern designers. His illustrations,
original, weird, grotesque, have gone all over
the world. They are found in every library. The people
enjoyed his work, and publishers eagerly sought it. He believed
in himself, labored hard for wealth and fame, and
was very successful. Like many artists, he struggled with
poverty at the first, but the time came when all luxury was
his to command and his name was a household word in
every land. It mattered little to him what the work was
upon which he employed his powers, if it only brought returns
in money and applause. We see him at one time
illustrating the filthy “<i>Contes Drolatiques</i>” and at another
the Holy Bible. But a true estimate of this man of splendid
gifts and wonderful versatility does not put him in the rank
of great artists. Perhaps, if in quantity his work had been
less, in quality it would have been better. He succeeded in
the beginning, and that may have been unfortunate. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
was always very well satisfied with his work, and he failed
to improve upon himself. Those who study him in his
works see possibilities in him which were never realized.
He produced nothing great in art which will live as a monument
to his genius. A great painting was what he always
intended to execute, but he died with the purpose unfulfilled.
The contrast between Millet and Doré has been remarked.
The former was devoted to art from motives high
and noble, while the other’s devotion was for the sake of
what he could make art pay him in money and fame. He
gained his ends, but it was in his power to do better, and his
career after all was not a success.</p>

<p>Personally Doré was frank and simple, and at times—with
his intimate friends—full of geniality. He had no affectation,
and was as ready as a child to speak his mind
about himself or others. He was sensitive to criticism, but
the opinion of others never changed his own good opinion
of himself. He was a man of moods. He said of himself
that sometimes he was mastered by a demon. He had fits
of melancholy and gloom which nothing could banish.
But at other times no one was more delightful as a companion.
He never married, but lived at his mother’s house in
the Rue St. Dominique, St. Germain. Here he had a small
studio, but in the Rue Bayard he had another larger one
which perhaps was the finest in Paris. Among his many
accomplishments was that of music. He sang well, and
played on a number of musical instruments. He was not a
society man, and spent but little time away from home.
His passion was for work, and with this thirty-five years of
his life were well filled. Early and late he labored, and
with astonishing rapidity. But his last picture is painted,
his last design made; and the things unseen and eternal, in
picturing which his pencil was sometimes employed, have
now become to him things seen and known.</p>

‘he made me pursue him on his own tactics, sir!’ General
Johnston is a handsome man, with the old campaigner

<p>Prof. W. F. Sherwin, of Cincinnati, tarried with us an
hour recently, when we found him in a very hopeful frame of
mind concerning the future of Chautauqua. We gleaned
the following from his conversation about the musical part
of the Chautauqua program for 1883: Chautauqua College
of Music Scheme for 1883: Musical Directors, Prof. W. F.
Sherwin, Cincinnati, O.; Prof. C. C. Case, Akron, O. Departments:
(1) Grand chorus, (2) Special class in English
glees and madrigals, (3) Harmony, (4) Voice culture, (5)
Elementary singing-school, (6) Children’s class. Directors
in charge: July 14 to 22, W. F. Sherwin; July 22 to
August 6, C. C. Case; August 7 to 18, W. F. Sherwin; August
19 to close of Assembly, C. C. Case. There will be occasional
lectures and “conversations” upon various topics of
practical interest, and the usual number of concerts, matinees,
organ recitals, etc. Prof. Davis, of Oberlin College, is
engaged as organist, and he will be ably assisted in the instrumental
department. There will be a quartette of eminent
soloists whose names will be announced in due time.
Arrangements are in progress for a Reading Circle which
shall be to musical people what the C. L. S. C. is to general
literature. The details of this are being arranged by Prof.
E. E. Ayres, of Richmond, Va., and will be published when
complete. On the whole it looks as if the Musical Directors
were determined to make that department superior to
what it has ever been in the past, and we hope that musical
people will sustain their efforts.</p>

French and English astronomers will also go there. The
principal objects are to obtain further knowledge of the
strange surroundings of the sun, which are ordinarily hidden
in the overpowering blaze of his central globe, and to
search for the planets which are supposed to exist between
Mercury and the sun. The total eclipse will last nearly six
minutes. Unfortunately, the total phase can be observed
only from two little islands in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Maria Louise Henry, in a recent number of <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, philosophizes on the works of Thackeray and
George Eliot in this way: “Thackeray had no real desire to
make men permanently dissatisfied with themselves, or the
world. He held that the world was not a bad place to be
born into, provided one learned what not to expect from it,
and could find a way to accommodate one’s self to one’s
place in it.” Speaking of George Eliot: “Her creed is a
kind of modern stoicism, or stoicism plus certain modern
ideas. It must be admitted that such a creed has in it much
of truth and nobleness. The only life worth living is the
life toward self, of infinite aspiration, and toward others of
infinitely active compassion. She will not allow, with
Thackeray, that we can strike an average of goodness, and
make ourselves content with that.”</p>

<p>It was a new <i>role</i> for the Rev. Dr. Talmage to be the chief
figure in a theatrical poster on bill-boards last month in
Brooklyn, N. Y. It is gratifying that the hand of <i>Justice</i>
removed the caricatures, and put an injunction on the managers
and prevented the performance. Caricaturing good
men and Christian ministers is an old habit of artists. In
1517 Martin Luther was represented by a German caricaturist
in a miserable picture, entitled “Luther Inspired by Satan;”
and John Calvin was caricatured as being tied with
ropes to a pillar and branded with an iron lily on the
shoulder; the name of the picture was “Calvin Branded.”
This picture was scattered all over France. Dr. Talmage is
in good company, even if he is caricatured more than any
other clergyman in America. “Blessed are ye when men
shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner
of evil against you falsely for my sake,” said Jesus Christ.</p>

poets feigned that his mother dipped him into the river
Styx to render him invulnerable, and that he was vulnerable

<p>A. By sending a six-cent stamp to the Soule Photograph
Co., (successors to John P. Soule), 338 Washington street,
Boston, Mass., a catalogue may be obtained of three thousand
seven hundred subjects of unmounted photographs of
ancient and modern works of art, embracing reproductions
of famous paintings, sculpture and architecture.</p>

<p>Q. What is the meaning and origin of “red-letter day?”</p>

<p>A. In almanacs holidays and saints’ days are printed in
red ink, other days in black. Any day to be recalled with
pleasure, or a lucky day, may be styled a “red-letter day.”</p>

<p>Q. In addition to the C. L. S. C. course for this year I
have taken the White Seal course. Where shall I send for
my examination papers?</p>

<p>A. To Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield, N. J.</p>

<p>Q. In Wheatland’s History it is stated that Pompeii and
and Herculaneum were Greek cities. Were they not Roman?</p>

<p>A. They were both Roman cities, situated in Southern
Italy at the base of Mt. Vesuvius.</p>

<p>Q. Will <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> please give a little information
concerning geodes? I can only find a mere definition
in the dictionaries at my command.</p>

<p>A. A geode is a hollow shell of stone, usually quartz, lined
with crystals pointing toward the center. These crystals
are generally of amethystine quartz, agate or chalcedony.
Besides quartz crystals, others of calcareous spar are sometimes
found in the cavities of geodes. Some of the most
remarkable specimens of quartz geodes are found loose in
the low stages of water in the rapids of the Upper Mississippi
river. On the outside they are rough and unsightly,
of a light brown color and of all sizes up to fifteen inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>Q. In the November <i>Chautauquan</i> Whittier is credited
with the authorship of the lines beginning “Ah, what
would the world be to us if the children were no more?”
Is not that a mistake?</p>

<p>A. Yes. The lines were written by Longfellow.</p>

<p>Q. Will the Editor’s Table please tell where is the nearest
local circle to Racine?</p>

<p>A. Ask Miss Kate F. Kimball, Plainfield, N. J., for the
information.</p>

<p>Q. I have long wished to know the difference between
Mahomet and Mohammed, will the <span class="smcap">Chautauquan</span> please
tell me?</p>

<p>A. Two forms of the same name—the former the French,
the latter the German form.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_DAILY_BREAD" id="OUR_DAILY_BREAD">OUR DAILY BREAD.</a></h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Heavy and sour bread or biscuit have a vast influence
through the digestive organs upon the measure of health
we enjoy. How important to our present happiness and
future usefulness the blessing of good health and a sound
constitution are, we can only realize when we have lost
them, and when it is too late to repair the damage. And
yet, notwithstanding these facts, thousands of persons in
our own city daily jeopardize not only their health, but
their lives, and the healths and lives of others, by using articles
in the preparation of their food, the purity and healthfulness
of which they know nothing. Perhaps a few cents
may have been saved, or it may have been more convenient
to obtain the articles used, and the housekeeper takes
the responsibility and possibly will never know the mischief
that has been wrought. <i>Pater familias</i> may have
spells of headache, Johnny may lose his appetite, Susie
may look pale; if so, the true cause is rarely suspected. The
weather, the lack of out door air, or some other cause, is
given, and the unwholesome, poisonous system of adulterated
food goes on. Next to the flour, which should be made
of good, sound wheat and not ground too fine, the yeast or
baking powder, which furnishes the rising properties, is of
the greatest importance, and of the two we prefer baking
powder, and <i>always use the Royal</i>, as we thereby retain the
original properties of the wheat, no fermentation taking
place. The action of the Royal Baking Powder upon the
dough is simply to swell it and form little cells through
every part. These cells are filled with carbonic acid gas,
which passes off during the process of baking.</p>

<p>The Royal is made from pure grape acid, and it is the action
of this acid upon highly carbonized bicarbonate of soda
that generates the gas alluded to; and these ingredients are
so pure and so perfectly fitted, tested and adapted to each
other, that the action is mild and permanent, and is continued
during the whole time of baking, and no residue
of poisonous ingredients remains to undermine the
health, no heavy biscuits, no sour bread, but if directions
are followed every article prepared with the Royal Baking
Powder will be found sweet and wholesome.</p>

<div class='booktitle'><b>Final Causes.</b></div>

<div class="hang1">
By Paul Janet, Member of the French Academy.
Translated from the Second Edition
of the French, with Preface, by <span class="smcap">Robert
Flint</span>, D.D., LL.D. 1 vol., 8vo, $2.50.</div>

<p>“The work of Janet is regarded as the most comprehensive
and ably-reasoned work on the philosophy of
final causes that has been produced. It is not a treatise
on natural theology, but a philosophical vindication of
the principle which underlies natural theology. M. Janet,
with admirable discernment, acute analytic power, and
strict regard to the requirements of logic, together with
a patient mastery of the facts out of which the question
arises, has placed the principle of final causes on a
strong foundation.”—<i>The Watchman.</i></p>

<div class='booktitle'>Short Studies on Great Subjects.</div>

<div class="hang1">

Oxford Counter-Reformation—Origen and Celsus—A
Cagliostro of the Second Century—Cheneys and the
House of Russell—A Siding at a Railway Station.</p>

<p>The chief interest of this volume centers in Mr.
Froude’s brilliant and vivid narrative of the Oxford religious
movement, of which Cardinal Newman was the
leader.</p>

<p>The London <i>Athenæum</i> says:</p>

<p>“In these personal recollections of a movement in
which his brother was one of the leaders, and in which
he himself for a while took part, we have Mr. Froude at
his best.... After all that has been said of late on the
subject of the Oxford Catholic revival, there is nothing
that can for a moment compare with these letters....
Some of Mr. Froude’s most perfect illustrations are to be
found in this volume, and who has given us such exquisite
images as he?”</p>

of “The Origin of Nations,” etc. 1 vol.,
12mo, $1.</div>

<p>Canon Rawlinson’s great learning and his highly esteemed
contributions to the history of the ancient world
qualify him to treat the subject of this volume with a
breadth of view and accuracy of knowledge that few
other writers can lay claim to. The treatise is not intended
to give an exhaustive view of the ancient religions,
but to enable students of history to gain a more
accurate knowledge of the inner life of the ancient world.</p>

<p>“It is not unlikely to prove true in the end that the
most useful popular service which Dr. McCosh has rendered
to the cause of right thinking and to a sound philosophy
of life is his proposed “Philosophic Series,” the

<p>This volume offers a new translation of the parts of

Translated and edited with an Introduction.
By <span class="smcap">Newman Smyth</span>, D.D., author of “Old
Faiths in a New Light,” “The Orthodox Theology
of To-day,” etc. 1 vol., 12mo, $1.</div>

<p>This is a faithful translation of that part of Dr. Dorner’s
“System of Christian Doctrine” which relates to the
future state of the soul; with an introduction and Notes
by Dr. Newman Smyth. The object of the book is to
set forth clearly and accurately the views of the great
German theologian on a subject of highest interest and
importance, wherein he has been strangely misrepresented
in this country, and particularly by the Rev.
Joseph Cook, in his recent lectures on Future Probation.</p>

<p>This volume is the account of a journey in the track
of the Israelites. All of Dr. Field’s powers of observation
and description are brought into play in this book,
which will undoubtedly prove the most delightful popular
narrative of travels in the desert of Mount Sinai that
has ever been written.</p>

New York <i>Herald</i>, with the Rodgers Search
Expedition; author of “Schwatka’s Search.”
1 vol, 8vo, with maps and illustrations, $4.</div>

<p>Mr. Gilder’s experience as an arctic traveler, and his
skill in the description of his journeys, have now given
him a reputation as one of the highest authorities on
polar expeditions. His new book is an account of the
voyage of the <i>Rodgers</i>, her discoveries and destruction;
with the thrilling personal narrative of his own solitary
and perilous journey of more than five thousand miles
through the Siberian wastes. The whole story of the
<i>Jeannette</i> is given from its papers and the accounts of
survivors. It will be seen that the volume possesses an
extraordinary interest.</p>


<div class="booktitle">Life of Lord Lawrence.</div>

<div class="hang1">
By <span class="smcap">R. Bosworth Smith</span>, M.A. With maps
and portraits. 2 vols., 8vo, $5.</div>

<p>This book contains the most vivid, full and authentic
account of the suppression of the Indian Mutiny, from
the point of view of one of the great actors in Indian
affairs, and from sources never hitherto open to the public.
It is also the life of one of the most heroic and genuine
characters of the times in which we live. Lord Lawrence
is known to his contemporaries as the savior of the
Indian Empire to the crown during the mutiny of 1857,
and as the singularly able and energetic Governor-General
of India in more recent times. Little, comparatively,
has been known of his personal character and
relations, since he had the modesty of a truly great man
in all that concerned his own achievements. Mr. Bosworth
Smith has given in his biography, a record worthy
of its subject. He has written with a noble enthusiasm,
and his book, in genuine human interest, in historical
importance, and in literary workmanship, is not second
to any biography that has appeared in recent times.</p>
